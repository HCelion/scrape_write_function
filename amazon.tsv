amazon	Mike	2018-07-19T19:44:53Z	1	Recently I changed Internet providers, Talk Talk to Now, all the equipment consisting of 2 mobile phones 1 Amazon Kindle Fire, Amazon Dot, 3 computers, Mac, Windows 7 & 10 and Amazon dot and echo.  The only problem I am having is with the echo and despite following the instructions to the letter several times I am still, unable to connect the echo to the internet, attempting to get assistance from Amazon is virtually impossible, I have no idea why? I need to find out how to resolve this issue before I take this matter further either through QVC Shopping channel or the courts.  Immediate assistance is required.  Being a long-standing customer of Amazon they would have my contact details.

amazon	Paul Kirby	2018-07-18T20:06:16Z	1	"Amazon represent some of the worst corporate behavior in online companies.  They seek to monopolize various platforms (e.g. video streaming - try buying an online video from anywhere else... it's almost impossible - that's called a monopoly and it's bad because it prevents competition - competition keeps the market prices fair and keeps the customer in control, not the corporation).  Also, it's almost impossible to close your Amazon account without jumping through 30 hoops (try it and see...).  They out-sourced billions of dollars to Asia - which isn't bad in itself, but they didn't do it to ""invest"" in Third World economies, the did it to save a buck (aka ""greed"") and they dramatically cut back on investing in a US workforce.  Jeff Bezos, as the CEO and owner, is very clearly driven by greed and has no national loyalties.  He's out-sourced to the cheapest labor force in the world, which means he's taken jobs away from Americans.When any company reaches the status of Corporate Giant, you lose that attention-to-detail that small local companies are so good at providing.  Here's an example of a product I bought recently through Amazon:I bought a 39 inch wide drip pan. Amazon Services are listed as the seller (no third party). I was mailed a 29 inch wide drip pan. Amazon totally screwed up and sent me the wrong product. When you live in a rural area, receiving the wrong product in the mail is incredibly frustrating. You then have to take the extra time to go into town to a USPS drop-off and mail it back and then wait for your refund. So much wasted time and money in ""limbo"" while you're waiting.I would discourage anyone from ordering a product from Amazon Services that requires anything other than them putting a product in box or envelope and mailing it - once you get into different sized products they don't have the Quality Controls in place to prevent very simple mistakes like this. Sadly, the fact that they are a big corporation means attention to detail like this will inevitably get overlooked. With that in mind, I would encourage people to pay the extra to buy products locally and not have to deal with very basic but time-consuming and costly mistakes."
amazon	Mindy Zhang	2018-07-18T18:04:16Z	4	Amazon is one of the websites that I trust to shop online. I have been using Amazon for more than 6 years. They have quick delivery and good tracking. When I did not receive an item, Amazon sent me another one without cost. This act has made me a faithful Amazon customer. Amazon deserves its reputation as one of the most popular e-commerce.

amazon	DEBBIE TUIT	2018-07-17T15:25:56Z	4	Always liked Amazon but when they went with USPS, their deliveries rarely come in two days for Prime customers especially if you use a PO box.
amazon	Jonas	2018-07-17T06:57:54Z	2	Horrible return-policy, not covering all costs associated with returns (even if item is defective).. This is the kind of company which will abuse the dominant position and jack up prices once they've conquered the world.. They lure sellers onto their platform, and once they see a product category becomes popular, Amazon starts selling it too..

amazon	Luca Proculo Gentile	2018-07-16T19:35:52Z	2	Amazon is Constantly blocking my account and canceling my ordersI give two stars just because of one problem:They are constantly blocking my account and canceling my orders ¨Because of safety reasons¨.It´s really annoying, I have spent all the day finding good discounts for the prime day and now I have lost all of it, many discounts were limited in the time, so I don´t have them anymore.By calling Amazon they can´t restore my order.I am quite sure that there were no wrong operations done on my account, can Amazon tell me why they are blocking it?AMAZON TI BLOCCA L´ACCOUNT QUANDO RICEVI SCONTI PER ARTICOLI COMPRATIMi e´ successo due volte ed ho visto che lo fanno spesso anche ad altra gente, basta fare una ricerca online.Dopo aver finito l´ordine ti mandano una email dicendo che ¨c´e´ stata una transazione sospetta¨ e poi cancellano ordine, password e carta di credito.Se vuoi riattivare l´ordine devi chiamare il servizio clienti parecchie volte, ti trovi a parlare con degli incompetenti che non sanno, o fanno finta di non sapere, l´andazzo di Amazon.Poi alla fine devi ordinare di nuovo tutto, a prezzi piu´ alti.Un consiglio?Andate su EBAY!
amazon	Ian Tipany	2018-07-16T15:38:01Z	2	I ordered goods from Amazon and when they didn't arrive by the date needed I tried contacting Amazon - not easy, as it turned out. When I did catch up with them I was told I had not ordered anything and they had not taken anything from my  account, so nothing to worry about. I called my card provider and they informed me that the money had been taken from my account. I then looked at my options and decided I would be better with nothing to do with Amazon. Then I received a message in German from the supplier of the goods. I still don't know what the messages were about as my German isn't up to much, but they seemed to be trying to get in touch and I presumed this was about delivery of the goods, now two days late. At that point I went back to my card provider. Their grounds for contesting a charge seem quite limited, and the only one open to me was non-delivery. I contested the charge on that basis, pointing out that Amazon said I hadn't paid anything, while their accounts showed the contrary. the day after I sent off the formal notice to my card provider the goods were left on my doorstep. Nobody signed for them. Next day I sent Amazon a message bringing them up to date and got a reply telling me I would have to log into my account but that is still non-existent as far as Amazon UK is aware. To log into my account I need information which I do not have and they say does not exist. They don't even recognise the email on which we have exchanged several messages in the past few days and want me to find a lot of further information which they say they don't have and which doesn't exist anyway, so that I can get rid of the goods they say I don't have,  that I now don't want. Somewhere there's a simple failure to communicate between Germany where the supplier is based, and the UK where I am based. But I am aware that some supplier in Germany is short of goods and money, which is unfair. And I have heard recently that Amazon's treatment of its junior employees is pretty rough, so I don't want to put any of the staff I have been dealing with into the firing line. What is to be done?
amazon	Ron	2018-07-16T07:40:38Z	1	Perhaps Amazon.com was a great company in the past, but I learned the hard way that my recent horrible experience with them was far from an isolated incident, as I have seen numerous other 1 star reviews for them lately. Everything that could go wrong....did go wrong. Took hours to sign up again, even though I was supposed to already be a member. They blatantly lied about the laptop I ordered. Said it had 4.0Ghz when it actually had 1.8. Screwed up my shipment numerous times and still tried to ship the order long after I cancelled it. Their customer service people were very rude in a matter of fact sort of way...as if their jobs were secure no  matter how bad they treat the customer. Big THUMBS DOWN TO THIS ROTTEN COMPANY!
amazon	Alan Benson	2018-07-15T10:16:20Z	1	Asked customer service with help on the description of a product I had just purchased as I believed the description to be wrong. The customer service rep did not acknowledge me and refused to help me.I could not believe what I was seeing in my chat window.

amazon	B Brown	2018-07-14T13:49:59Z	1	You can't trust reviews for anything on this site. How do they let sellers get away with this. If you find a product with great reviews, check them carefully. Either they could be all nonverified or reviews for numerous different products that aren't related to the listing in any way.

amazon	Sharan	2018-07-12T21:28:38Z	1	The reason I have awarded AMAZON just 1 star, is due to the fact that I placed an order for Avon Skin So Soft, and was extremely suprised to see a very 'fake' looking label, with Polish instructions and a barcode which was un-identifiable when scanned!What appears to be the genuine article....is probably fake! It doesnt even smell like the original!When I added a similar review to this, they failed to list it......I wonder why!

amazon	Viper11	2018-07-11T17:04:46Z	4	I have been a customer for years and they have always taken care of any issues that have come up.  The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that the cost of Prime is too much, especially considering their competitors offer similar services for FREE.  For me, the pros still outweigh the cons and Amazon has done a good job over the years trying to add more value to a Prime membership.
amazon	sally	2018-07-11T14:43:08Z	1	I am so happy that I broke up with Amazon.I use to use them for almost everything. I have found that if I go directly to the companies I wish to order from that I am actually saving money! Not a lot but a few$$. But this all adds up and the idea that you are saving on Amazon is not true in most cases. Start supporting the people that make the products you like. There is no reason for Amazon to be the middleman.

amazon	NUFAN	2018-07-09T10:15:03Z	4	PROS:* Fast delivery on most products.* Refunds very easily resolved.* Good(ish) customer service.* SO much choice.CONS:*Annual fee - Lets be honest, is this really necessary? £79 is steep. I mean its good having prime video but I would be quite happy just to pay £25 a year (example) for prime shopping.*Some products (mostly electrical) seem to be of poor quality. I have brought several electrical products (known brands) only for them to fail upon setup. Quite alarmed at the quality. Refund was swift but I am cautious to buy anything electrical now via Prime.

amazon	Fanny	2018-07-08T01:13:55Z	5	Up to today, I have no issue with AmazonOrders arrived on time, or before. The only time I had a problem with a book which arrived damaged, they sent me a new one, without returning the first one.I'm doing international shipping, and when it seems that it is too much and that I should pay customs, they made me paid for it, and if I paid to must they refund me, and if it is more they paid for the differenceAnd if I paid customs when they didn't ask me, I can ask the refund of the charged on the website, as I shouldn't be paying it .... Perfect! Will keep ordering with them
amazon	Shane	2018-07-07T22:18:59Z	5	I find it hard to understand all the negative feedback about their customer service as I have always found them to be exceptionally helpful and I have never had any issues returning any items and I find the Prime membership to be excellent value for money. I was a little niggled that they stopped LoveFilm last year but apart from that in over 7 years of using Amazon I have always found their service to be exemplary.
amazon	Pratik Patel	2018-07-07T19:08:10Z	1	Ordered maybe 3 things so far all paid for on special delvery and without fail everyone has been delayed over a week.Latest excuse today what that they handed the parcel to the wrong courier so my parcel will be delayed another week because common sense.

amazon	Flemming Ast	2018-07-05T08:58:58Z	1	Amazon does not enforce product control. Just bought a camera from your German subsidiary.Only Chinese and Slavic languages. At return Amazon stated that the purchase would be refunded.This has not happened after 30+ days.In short. You can not use competitive pricing when shipped products are unusable.Your product return service as to shipping the produces is not existing. I payed 1/2 the product price i shipping to return the product.It take one bad experience to loose a customer.

amazon	Tom Edison	2018-07-03T19:41:17Z	5	"I have done business with Amazon.com for many, many years, and have been quite satisfied with them...until I moved.Now, the only packages that are delivered to my door are those scheduled for delivery on Sundays. (or FedEx or UPS) I am 3/4 of a mile from the mailbox and the USPS only has to go 1/2 mile to deliver a package to your door. On ""Amazon Sunday"" those US Postal Service rules do not apply. On regular days, they drag their feet and I have to pick everything up at the post office...but on Sunday, everything is brought directly to my door. Go figure *that* one out.Having Amazon Prime, I would like to be able to specify the delivery date. I know it would cost them more, but hey...they just raised the price of Prim by 20 bucks anyhow. Their billions can handle it...and I'd buy more stuff."

Thousands of sellers and clients complain that they are suspended for no or little reason. My suspicion is that amazon wants to sell your goods from their own stores and earn the higher amount of money.This ""selling your private things from the amazon stores"" is a new idea and possibilty they offer you to re-open your account."

Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement. SERIOUSLY!? For the past 10 orders, I do not have any problems with my billing address. In the end have to create a brand new account.
amazon	Samuel Adams	2018-06-28T18:36:27Z	4	I've been an Amazon Prime customer for several years. Well worth the annual fee in what they save me on shipping charges, not to mention the added bonus of their Prime video service. There are many things I don't buy on Amazon because, when I can, I still like to patronize small local vendors, even if it costs me a few dollars more than Amazon. However Amazon's prices are admittedly often difficult to beat. They also have great customer service and have quickly resolved every problem I've ever had. However, one problem I've sometimes had, and many other Amazon customers complain about, are their packaging monkeys (one star off for that). It's not uncommon where they'll take a small package and ship it in a larger box with no padding. Good way to wind up with damaged merchandise that has to be returned (thankfully Amazon always covers the return shipping). One thing I rarely fail to do is when trying to decide between Product A, B, C I read Amazon customer reviews. There's a wealth of knowledge to be gained from reading the experiences of other customers who've bought a particular product. I also love being able to post my questions and get responses from other customers. Thank you Amazon!

I did request for return but still no action was taken either by amazon or the seller.  In spite I send them repeated messages.  This is totally nonsense.  I never use amazon again in my life time. Poor customer service.
amazon	Obiageri Okafor	2018-06-27T13:01:15Z	1	"Thing is, to survive and make income on their publishing sites as an indie author, you have to spend so much money. I have never seen a company that pilfers and steals from its customers like this website does. They make sales with your product and then ban you or block the product without even giving you the sales made from it. How can y'all be inconsiderate? What do you need or profit from such strict rules that make no sense. I have published my own books free from copyright but they banned all of those giving stupid reasons that they are copyright. How can my brain give me words that are copyright. Even your website name is copyright, your website are still steaming from fake reviews. I just hate the sound of your company...its disheartening to rip off money from people without any just explanation. All you would say is ""Violation of Copyrights"". I am ashamed for you all, owner, workers and every darn thing y'all doI rather patronize D2D retail stores and be happier than you pack of liars"

amazon	Shaun Peter	2018-06-26T07:05:57Z	1	"My issue has finally been resolved, after 20 hours of stress, after 18 customer service reps who refused to look into the fact I had been charged for cancelled orders. Finally, I was correct, and a refund from Amazon appeared in my account. A month after my purchase.Your service reps make assumptions, have not been trained well, and assume the way Amazon SHOULD work is the way it always DOES work. 16 of 18 service reps told me my card was only preauthorized, without even knowing that Amazon can't preauth pinless debit cards and charges the full amount when preparing for shipping. Everyone just assumed I was wrong and didn't look into it or handle it. I learned more from reading Amazon's FAQ than the service reps had learned from training.I'm a writer currently writing an article about this, I feel I have to. This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life. The title of the article is ""Too Big To Care"".I especially dislike the service rep who told me in different words that Amazon doesn't make mistakes, and to never contact amazon customer service about this issue again or I won't receive a reply.The bank was on my side. I had submitted proof from my bank. The transactions were the exact amount of my cancelled orders. I had verified with my bank five times that these were not preauthorizations. Still, I was not believed and I slipped through the cracks because nobody believes Amazon could make a mistake. I requested my case be escalated to a manager or ombudsman and it was not. You truly do not care and think every customer is an idiot. I have a 148 IQ and a Master's degree and I was treated like a stupid mistaken child.After spending a huge chunk of my income with Amazon for a large portion of my life, I am done. I will no longer buy anything from Amazon. You treated me like crap and didn't believe me, and even after the bank told me you had refunded me one month later, you didn't acknowledge your mistake or apologize.Thanks for the refund. However, due to the stress and wasted time you caused me I'm devoting the rest of my life to let everyone know on social media and in the real world how much Amazon sucks, doesn't care, steals money and refuses to fix it, then when they finally do realize and fix it, I have to hear about it from my bank.Amazon has truly become #toobigtocare. Keep an eye out for that hashtag in the future, because I will put it everywhere. Charging loyal customers 265 USD for 60 dollars of merchandise and then refusing to acknowledge the possibility that Amazon made a mistake is no way to go through life, Amazon."

amazon	Sam Wong	2018-06-23T16:54:10Z	2	The customer service is terrible in Amazon.  I was having trouble with being charged from Amazon for no reason.  They claimed that I have the kindle membership and also the kindle music. I talked to the bank and disputed, but I got charges every month.  Then I called Amazon trying to resolve the issue, they are not very cooperative. I recommend anyone who has Amazon account to check if they are charged mysteriously from them.  Their stock price and revenue continue to be up, but I am question if it is because of the reason I just stated above. At the end, I gave up, I have to cancel my credit card and concluded it as a fraud to get my money back.  It is a terrible process.
amazon	A G H	2018-06-23T15:33:48Z	1	I ordered 5 items on Sunday for delivery on Tuesday and Wednesday. An inflatable dinghy and accessories. The accessories arrived along with a drum kit, no dinghy, now I have an engine to attach to a bass drum, I doubt it will float! I sent Amazon feedback about the picture they send confirming delivery two days ago, no contact from them at all! On their website this morning, no way to contact someone, but I can return my dinghy if I wish! Chance would be a fine thing. Avoid dealing with this company, in theory the offering is good, but if you can mistake a dinghy for a drum kit, well enough said. I'll update if anyone bothers to contact me!

I make a couple of orders every month. During the years, only twice my packages were lost I have been refunded promptly. Another time I received an item (a t-shirt) with the wrong color, and again they promptly replaced it.Just be aware of shops when the sale and shipment is not handled exclusively by Amazon. Check their rating carefully. Amazon is filtering and checking quality a lot but a ""black sheep"" can always be met."

amazon	Sarah Phillips	2018-06-22T16:10:59Z	1	Ho passato una settimana cercando di fare arrivare i miei prodotti. Sono rimasta a casa 3 giorni per aspettarli. Sono stata scaricata da un operatore ad un altro. Il corriere Amazon si perdeva sempre e non è mai arrivata a destinazione. L'altro corriere faceva le finte consegne in rete (controllando direttamente con i responsabili di zona le consegna che risultavano a video in realtà non erano programmate) e poi cominciavano le storielline tipo 'il corriere ha forato vicino a casa sua e se n'e andato a riparare la gomma!!! ì Comodo di venerdì sera quando non riescono ad andare in consegna. Cosi mi hanno invitato ad andare in persona a ritirare la merce. Ma secondo voi se avessi voluto andare a fare lo shopping in persona sarei andata al centro commerciale vero? Invece di pagare in anticipo online - si, hanno addebitato la carta di credito e chissa se mai rivedrò i soldi per la merce mai ricevuta....pessima esperienza. Hanno problemi di logistica e di formazione personale.I spent a week trying to get my Amazon purchases to arrive. I was passed from one customer service rep to another (6 in all in 5 days). The Amazon delivery driver got lost and couldn't find the house. The first one said he would take the goods back because Amazon would contact me in any case and then they would deliver another day. The other shipper firstly put fake delivery details on his website - when I actually phoned to ask, the area manager confirmed that there was no actual delivery planned.Then after 3 days when they were supposed to turn up again (they planned the delivery for a Friday afternoon after 4.30pm) 'unfortunately' the driver got a flat tyre on the gravel road just outside my house. So he went to get it fixed. Silly boy! Why didn't he phone me??? I could have gone and got the goods - that is if he had been there! So this shipper actually invited me to go and get the good myself! Don't you think that if I had wanted to go and buy the goods at a shopping centre without actually having to pay in advance (yes of course they already debited my Visa - and no little amount either - around E200) I would have done so??? Who knows when or i I will get my money back! Terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - except maybe if you live near to their depot so even if they don't deliver you can take a walk and go and get the stuff! Amazon Italy has serious problems with logistics and customer services personnel. Another world.
amazon	Siya	2018-06-22T11:42:42Z	1	Amazon India, a shameless #ecommerce brand in #India, they can repeat the same fault no of times even I've faced the same problem more then 3 times. I personally recommend never trust on Amazon India
amazon	Carsten	2018-06-22T05:04:47Z	2	Whats going on with Amazon? Items never coming or they are damaged. I decided to give them one more chance and now 2 days have passed and the item is not even dispatched yet!You are loosing me
amazon	Matthew	2018-06-21T17:53:08Z	5	Never had any issues, they have spoilt me for other online shops because of the choice, price and amazing swift prime delivery.Order a lot of things from amazon on like training supplements, phone covers and cables, clothes, healthy snacks, cleaning products etc. The choice of products and range within each product category is fantastic!! Had prime for a long time now and can't fault it at all!! Well worth the money between the tv, extra deals and swift guaranteed delivery!!!  Will continue to be a loyal customer for years to come.
amazon	Jane Louise Austin	2018-06-21T17:50:18Z	1	★   from Amazon Customer on 21 June 2018 Amazon in Breach of Sale of Goods ActI bought a brand new HD Fire 8 Tablet. This item became faulty within a few weeks, but Amazon want to replace it for a second hand refurbished item. Amazon are refusing to provide a like for like brand new replacement or a refund! This is in breach of the Sale of Goods Act. I will therefore be reporting them to Trading Standards. The item is still under warranty.
amazon	Jay Rodriguez	2018-06-21T17:22:10Z	1	Amazon has gone from a trusted company to a monopoly which does not care for its consumers.I had a package which showed as arrived but was unable to locate the package. I contacted Amazon after I gave the package another day to arrive, they suggested give it 72 more hours just to verify. Instead of attempting to figure out what is happening, the blame was shifted to me and the shipping company. They advised only if I am able to produce a police report will they be able to investigate further otherwise tough luck. After calling the police and my checking with my neighbors, no one saw anything and the police are not willing to help since there is no information to go off of. So now I am out my product and the money. This is unacceptable and I will not stop until every review site, the Better Business Bureau, and if need be my lawyer hear about this horrendous service by Amazon.
amazon	Abbie	2018-06-21T15:33:06Z	2	customer care is poor, takes ages getting through
amazon	Abigail	2018-06-21T14:14:15Z	4	I purchase hundreds of items a year through Amazon. I got the prime membership and it has been proved to be very worthy. The only thing is you need to have enough wisdom to find the best thing.

amazon	Christine L	2018-06-20T18:43:25Z	1	Used to be a great company, had superb customer service until recently. Items getting lost, wrong shipments, delayed delivery, which I can all somewhat tolerate, because of the great customer service that provide speedy resolution to all of those issues above. However, my last experience with the company was bad enough for me to write an review. I made a wrong order and tried to cancel. Contacted customer service on day one, was assured that when the item gets shipped out, I will be get my gift card credit back so I can immediate make another order. I was satisfied with what was promised to me as it felt like it was a reasonable resolution. Representative even said she'll personally ensure this to go through. Item shipped, didn't get my refund. Contacted customer service again and said refund will be issued within an hour. After an hour, no refund still. Contacted customer service the third time, and got told sorry you just have to wait, takes up to 24-48 hours for refund to go through. Supervisor refused to resolve this, despite the fact i've got similar situation resolved with instant refund. My main issue with Amazon's customer service is, don't promise me things that you cannot deliver, twice, and then tell me that's not how your policy works on the third time.
amazon	Upthrust Consulting	2018-06-20T10:56:35Z	5	so special in its own way of service delivery
amazon	faith storm	2018-06-19T22:47:51Z	3	Buying an item is fine, however returning is quite a hassle, first my package got lost then they were unable refund me my money because they lost my package. The chat room with them was spotty and 2 minutes turned into an hour. I'm actually kind've frustrated by the whole experience.
amazon	phayeedat	2018-06-19T15:05:24Z	5	To return an item, superb. To buy an item, superb. To search for an item, superb. To speak to customer support, superb. Love Amazon and all its features. If any growth is to be addressed, probably in the outdated facebook layout of shopping, very uninteresting and bland, if more graphics were used to push products, yall could be the online target!
amazon	A M	2018-06-19T14:50:22Z	1	Very poor customer service for seller. It took me over two month to set up the business, customer service officers have no access to the problem, the seller verification team do not give contact number so can not communicate directly to them, they do not share information with Amazon customer service team either. During last 5 weeks, I rang them 15 times and opened 10 cases but very poor and vague response.
amazon	Jerry Ampofo	2018-06-19T13:02:39Z	5	Great always use them no problems

amazon	Deborah	2018-06-15T01:53:17Z	1	AMAZON ARE A JOKE TO TRY AND SELL ON...BEWARE OF THIS HAPPENING TO NEW SELLERS ON AMAZON.I honestly wish that I could give them 0 stars for how I have been treated by them..I opened an individual seller account, and listed some items - I clicked on items they had in their own product category and amended the staus for the ones I had. All seemed fine - then after only 2 days I find that Amazon has restricted my selling account as they think that some of the items are fraudulent - I would never sell items that were not genuine. Well my problem was that as I purchased items years ago so I could not supply an invoice within the past year, and inventory would therefore not match the listings, also asking for supply chain was absolutely ludicrous of them in my situation, being an individual who had bought items from lots of different places, and even some of the people I purchased from may not trade any more... As a result of this restriction, I did post one item which counted towards the £30 selling fee, leaving me owing £10 to them -- (me out of pocket for that game), but the other items that people had ordered had to be cancelled, seeing as though if Amazon would not pay me, then there was no way that I would send the items and hence be even more out of pocket myself.Their appeal process proved absolutely useless in my case and my selling privileges have been removed. I have tried on numerous occasions for some resolution to no avail.  I, therefore, am not going to pay them the £10 still owing to them for less than one day of being able to sell on their site.I THINK THEIR SERVICE ABSOLUTELY STINKS AND THIS ONLY HAPPENED DUE TO CLICKING ON PRODUCTS THEY HAD IN THEIR INVENTORY CATALOGUE - SO MUCH FOR MAKING THINGS SIMPLER TO LIST -- THEY HAVE SCREWED ME RIGHT OVER AND I REFUSE TO USE THEM EVER AGAIN = THEY HAVE NOW LOST SOMEONE WHO WOULD ALSO BUY FROM THEIR SITE TOO...PLEASE REPLY TO THIS IF YOU HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TRYING TO SELL WITH THEM== MAYBE THEY NEED TO SORT OUT HOW THINGS LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN.update 16th June 2018 - they have now had the audacity to take the £10.52 out of my bank so having to go to the bank to dispute it seeing as though they have not exactly done what they promised - I am formerly complaining to them, and thinking about using an ombudsman, or going to the papers.. :(

amazon	Aaron	2018-06-12T10:01:17Z	1	"Outside of the US? Do not rely on Amazon(.com) to support your transaction all the way through to delivery!This 1 star doesn't represent the item in any way, because I didn't receive it!After receiving the delivery slip through the door by Yodel (of all people) stating it had been left in a safe place, but failed to specify where, I went through a two week back and forth with Amazon about where my item was. They couldn't (or wouldn't) provide the details of the delivery or be bothered to investigate Yodel properly to find out where my parcel had gone. In the end they they said would refund me if I provided a crime report, however my report was refused by my local police department due to the item failing to be delivered. My country's laws state that as the item wasn't received it cannot be classed as potentially stolen therefore no crime occurred. But Amazon seems to think they're above such laws and had the audacity to blame me for the failure of delivery, churning the same old statement about their terms and conditions to me over and over again that once an item has been ""delivered"" it becomes my responsibility. I'm pretty sure the onus is on them to actually use a half decent and competent courier service when handling such expensive goods.First and last item I will attempt to purchase with Amazon.com as a UK buyer, and pretty sure I'll avoid buying such high value items with Amazon in general in future.F YOU, Amazon."
amazon	John	2018-06-12T08:57:57Z	5	I love Amazon, addicted to Prime in every way. Great service and communication!
amazon	Victor Neitman	2018-06-12T08:46:56Z	4	Amazon is obviously great in terms of getting whatever you need delivered in prime time.I have had a few hiccups regarding delivery of items. Sometimes they aren't what they are advertised to be and it can be a hassle to sort it out. This is a rare case though. Have recently bought a water filter which is working great, very useful when all of London serves hard water.
amazon	Carla	2018-06-12T03:23:33Z	1	Amazon is a SCAM.You can buy their overpriced items anywhere else. I was offered an Amazon credit card that they later didn't provide a link on the Amazon website, causing me to have trouble paying. Seller experience is awful -- buyers don't read the listings and expect every item to be new even if it is listed as new, buyers don't ask for a return and leave a 1 star review and don't respond to messages... And Amazon doesn't remove those reviews! Amazon charges the customer a flat rate for shipping, regardless of the weight of the item, which is far more expensive than necessary for items under 1lb. Amazon also uses boxes that are too big in order to charge sellers extra. Sellers pay exorbitant fees for storage  and the mere privilege to sell on Amazon, which is forwarded to the buyer in the form of item prices. Don't be a bezo, use eBay or other sites instead. He is scamming sellers and buyers alike, how do you think he became the richest person on the planet?
amazon	Marge Ainsworths	2018-06-11T20:53:03Z	5	I love amazon, I buy many things on here, more then I should anyway. If I ever have any problems they always resolve it quickly.
amazon	Mark Ward	2018-06-11T13:20:06Z	2	I think considering Amazon is a multi-billion pound company they should give you an average time when your parcel will be delivered instead of having to wait in from 8 o'clock in the morning till 9 at night for your parcel to get delivered they say they can leave it somewhere but what if you don't have anywhere to leave it as it will get stolen I think it is ridiculous and they need to look into this matter to give people around about time your parcel will be getting delivered instead of having to hang around all day especially on a Day Like This with the sun is shining you don't get many they seem to be up to date with everything else so why not delivery times
amazon	kat	2018-06-11T13:17:05Z	1	amazon suspended my account after I reported a dvd review that was not in fact a review but a troll using racist remarks. their own  customer service sided with me and also reported the comment,  they claim my account was suspended by accident?? HAHAHAH yeah right you bigots. i go on to surf and buy dvds i don't care what color anyone is , the color of someones skin be it white, black or indifferent has nothing to do with a dvd review???  I want my account close and am returning purchased items I just received, I have made numerous purchases. they re activated my account after 10 minutes, i will never shop there again also got rid of my 10,000 prime credit card, your loss not mine, plenty of other online places to shop
amazon	Mark Whitehall	2018-06-11T07:03:26Z	4	I love the service. Amazon is an immensely convenient company as it as a house with most thing's you can imagine under one roof. Something's (product's) do however require me to pay for prime despite not needing a reason in my opinion, I don't know why but if someone does know please let me know. Another minor inconvenience is when I need multiple deliveries as some people don't use FBA. Despite that all it good.

Was told to file a police report after 3 weeks of never sending an email which was promised about the issue, will never shop here again. paid 200 dollars for no reason and still no service.
amazon	Karin	2018-06-08T00:24:42Z	4	Amazon has been pretty helpful for most occasions. Sometimes their third world customer service associates have difficulty understand what I am trying to explain in email, but they do try their best to guide me on what I need to do. Refunds are easily dealt with if you purchase directly from Amazon, make sure you read return policies for third party sellers using Amazon as a platform.
amazon	Otso	2018-06-07T22:09:20Z	1	Amazon stole £100 from me via Fraudulant Vouchers They were purchased as a gift by former colleagues. I saved them for a few months then tried to use them, they were duds. The shop they had been bought from had closed down so couldn't take them back. Amazon admitted, eventually, they were fraudulant and I'm a victim. But they refused to do anything about it, washed their hands clean.Absolutely disgusting behaviour. No wonder they're taking over the world...

I have screen shots to prove it amynone just look up trick or treat Halloween Roseanne dvd, in negative reviews and you will see it. who wants to see that crap while cruising for dvds with the kids? I have screen shots and plus anyone can see the review  look up Roseanne tricks or treats  second page review near bottomnotice review stating white trash? after messaging amazon claimed it didn't violate guidelines???? im Asian an offended by this bs what does race have to do with a dvd review????

Rang customer services on first attempt not got to a person. 2nd time spoke to a very pleasant customer service person  only to find out I had been charged £12 and £5 for late payment. I have not received any statement by e-mail and they don't send in post. I note this has happened to others just a way of making money.

amazon	Natalie Regester	2018-05-29T01:36:06Z	5	I Have had nothing but great service and all my products were wonderful and if they were not they fixed it
amazon	Irene Stape	2018-05-28T23:39:31Z	2	I have been an Amazon customer for over ten years.  The customer service has truly declined in the past few years.  Mostly because information gets lost in translation.  They will not even do price adjustments on there own products. But the worse is if you do any trading with them you will get ripped off if you don't stay on  top of them. I have had many bad trading experiences with them.
amazon	Travelling Lanes	2018-05-28T20:05:55Z	4	4/5 from a repeat customerI often choose to buy via Amazon because I trust the product reviews other customers leave, I find the reviews to be super helpful. The prices of Amazon products are usually the most competitive, and only Ebay are usually any cheaper, if at all.I did try Amazon as a seller, selling a few electrical bits, but I found that Amazon fiercely favour buyer rights and buyers often abused the system to get refunds, even after using the items they'd bought! So as a buyer I'd really reccomend Amazon, but as a seller, stick to Gumtree or Facebook for selling as you won't get scammed!
amazon	Glamm by Dianne	2018-05-28T00:18:39Z	5	They delivered what I ordered in time. it was in perfect condition and I aim happy using amazon

amazon	Mr.Tom	2018-05-27T16:46:04Z	1	"I bought an baritone ukulele from Amazon, and when I received it, it had a warped neck .Customer Service would ""not"" help me, so they sent me to this so-called ""Amazon executive customer relations group"" in regards to my issue. This group ""TOTALLY"" did not care about who I was, and the money that I lost in regards to this issue. I actually write commercially licensed music, and there was a contracted deal with paid royalties in perpetuity that I needed this Baritone Ukulele for in regards to the song I was writing.. and again.. the ONLY THING that this so called upper tier so-called Amazon executive customer relations group would do is just tell me that I need to waste MORE OF MY TIME and send the baritone ukulele back to them.. THEN MAYBE they would refund my money! REALLY!?!?! This Amazon group was also VERY RUDE AND INSULTING to me in there over all tone and also lack of following up with my MANY email replies. No matter how much money that I LOST in regards to the contracted deal that I could not write this song for, because of receiving a defective instrument that Amazon is responsible FOR.. that did not matter to them.. AT ALL. The ironic thing, is that one of my own digital partners, is selling one of my song on Amazon... and I'm certainly going to tell them on how Amazon treats songwriters / composers."
amazon	Ms. Benett	2018-05-25T14:08:52Z	5	Amazing experience with them all the time! Make my life much easier
amazon	DA	2018-05-24T16:27:49Z	1	Amazon asked me for a review of their Prime membership. Because my review was not exactly positive (they had just increased the fees and offered nothing for it) they refused to post it and sent me a message that it doesn't comply with their policy. In other words their policy is to post only good reviews about themselves. Is this honest?
amazon	Josh Adams	2018-05-24T14:25:20Z	5	Love Amazon and the prime membership options.
amazon	Steven	2018-05-24T13:15:06Z	4	Ordered some books. Got some books around the time they promised I'll get them.
amazon	Freddy Herteleer	2018-05-24T09:01:27Z	5	exceeding my expectations
amazon	Susie	2018-05-24T07:56:37Z	5	I really cannot say anything bad about them. When ever I have or had problems they have been extremely swift in sorting them out. Since joining prime it is even better. Majority of my parcels are next day delivery which is a great bonus. With the amount of deliveries I have had I have certainly covered the cost of prime and even better off by a few £’s. The drivers are very polite and pleasant. Highly recommended.
amazon	Paul Steed	2018-05-24T04:44:44Z	4	I've bought a few things through Amazon now and had always got frustrated at how I always seemed to find myself signed up for PRIME, no matter how mant times I'm sure I'd clicked that I didn't want it.This time is was for a Garden Furniture Set, which features in another review, where the sale and delivery couldn't have gone more wrong. It took a long time to resolve, far too long possibly, but in the end they've now refunded the cost and told me to keep the item. OK, it's got some nuts and bolts missing, but I'm sure I can buy them from somewhere.I can't but a Company down for making an excellent effort, especially as the main problem was down to someone else.
amazon	Elizabeth Brown	2018-05-24T03:42:10Z	5	I love love love amazon. You can get anything you need and everything you need from this site. Sometimes there are problems but for the most part it always seems to work great!
amazon	Kyle Marks	2018-05-23T23:08:07Z	1	"They don't screen their sellers well enough! I was send a totally different item then the picture!!!! The seller says its the same and I have to pay return shipping to CHINA!  Please DON""T DO BUSINESS with amazon.comPS How is it fair that they can ship from CHINA for $1 but it cost $30 to ship something from USA BACK TO CHINA!? Donald Trump SHOULD FIX THAT BS."
amazon	Jane Kaiser	2018-05-23T19:53:36Z	5	Amazon is great
amazon	David.S	2018-05-22T15:05:22Z	5	I have ordered a lot of stuff in my time being with Amazon, a lot more than I should publicly admit. Whenever I have ordered anything from them it has always been delivered on time to what they estimate and in good condition. Even when there have been times that the product was just not right or faulty for whatever reason, their refund system has always been easy and straight forward to use. Although I'd have to say that their Pass the Parcel scheme is good in practice it's just not best when you go to one of these designated places and they look down upon you for daring to do a refund in their shop. But clearly not an Amazon issue. My only issue and it would be more search related is that some items are cryptically hidden on the website so you will need to be really specific or it may just not be on there. If I'm searching for a Man United baby-grow I will most certainly be offended if you suggest a Liverpool one!
amazon	James Carbone	2018-05-21T14:26:47Z	4	Amazon got a fast delivery, the prices are not too high and they have a great stock.
amazon	Ella Jane Michael	2018-05-19T20:26:02Z	3	I ordered a Samsung S7 phone and it arrived last week May 4. I am very disappointed with the unit bcause the battery drain fast. I contacted their customer service the first time and the guy who answered the phone was looks unknowledgeable that's when  I told him that I need to speak to the manager or anyone who can really help me. The customer service agent then transfered the call and the manager rest assured that they will be refunding my bucks. Really disappointed!
amazon	Jennifer Mcpherson	2018-05-18T14:53:30Z	5	Fantastic prices and came next day as promised
amazon	John F	2018-05-17T11:47:36Z	3	They lost my package, then found it.. then lost it and then i was double charged. It was refunded in the end but It was a right faff on.
amazon	jpe	2018-05-17T10:27:50Z	5	I ordered a TV from Amazon which was unfortunately lost when out for delivery. Got in contact with their support team and explained the situation. Got a full refund back a 1 free month of Amazon Prime which was nice of them. They have a great support team would recommend
amazon	Ignacio	2018-05-16T10:06:31Z	5	Great customer service.I have been buying in Amazon for two years. i had two problems with two products, in one case they replace it for free and in the other case they refunded me without even having to return the faulty item. They were also very polite and the customer service chat is quick and easy.
amazon	Marta Chamska	2018-05-15T16:50:29Z	1	Where to start! I am 35 weeks pregnant and have ordered 2 medium ticket items for the baby from amazon last Wednesday. Having had limited communication I today received an email about automatic refund- with no explanation why that is.Now the refund is not so automatic- as it takes 5-7 business days apparently- which is just poor, especially given that I would have been quite happy to be offered re- delivery/ replacement as I found out that my parcel was damaged in transit - I had to call customer service as this information was not available in the email. Now you would think- that this should be pretty straightforward conversation and straightforward resolution- except it was anything but!!!Effectively having spent 30min having circular conversation getting me absolutely nowhere. I will have to wait for the refund to be processed 5- 7 days and if I still want the items I will have to re-order them again- which amazon will charge me for again. This effectively means that I would have had £300 out of my account- rather than £150-which I cannot afford!!After 25min of conversation I was offered £40 discount- which is all well and good if you actually have spare cash to fork out to pay again for the items you have already been charged for while they are processing the refund! Mind boggles! The whole experience has caused me significant inconvenience and great deal of frustration. Computer says- NO!! it seems, and common sense is not Amazon strongest forte. Needless to say, I will not be using Amazon for future purchases. I had similar experience few years back and ceased to order from amazon for a number of years and I am disappointed to report that unfortunately in this time nothing has changed. Now having this experience for the second time- it is with regret- I will most certainly not be a returning customer and shall delete the account as soon as my refund is processed.
amazon	Terry Elliott	2018-05-15T15:13:11Z	1	"I ordered 2 mobile phones from Amazon. After a short while one broke down.  I then discovered that the phones had been mis-sold in that they had been used in the USA and the warranty had expired 4 months before I received them.  I had proof of this from HTC but Amazon refused to take any action.  I therefore have 2 useless bricks which I paid over £600 for less than 6 months ago.  What's even worse is that Amazon won't tell me why they are not upholding my complaint.  I appealed to them but their rules say ""if you don't hear within 3 days, assume your appeal has been refused"".  In those circumstances they can't even be bothered to write individually.  Amazon - trustworthy.  I think not."
amazon	Tyler O'Sullivan	2018-05-15T13:59:19Z	1	Unacceptable ordered a speaker a few other items and amazon send condoms and women’s razor blades, very embarrassing opening that package up in front of my mum. Also the customer service on the follow up was frustrating and had me now not wanting to use amazon again. I was told to print a label to return the item?? I refused. I was also told my order needed to be refunded and ordered again. The guy kept using the word replacement which was frustrating as the original item was not sent out so I’m not sure what there was to replace. Disappointed in the service of a company I use a lot.

amazon	Hannah Lanayru	2018-05-15T05:04:00Z	5	Wonderful online retailer. It's just awesome. You just gotta know what you're doing. Some of the bad reviews look like they're just butt hurt or didn't know what they were doing. Or both. I have never had a problem. Of course you didn't do your research and it's not amazon's fault if you get stuck with a fake product . Shame on you. When products get lost or damaged, just remember that no one is perfect and life happens. So don't get your panties in a knot if something goes wrong. Now, if they start acting horrible and charge you for things they shouldn't be, then you'd have a problem. I have never had this problem. Ever. And my family buys a lot of stuff on Amazon year round through several different accounts. So good job Amazon! Don't let those horribly written reviews bother you! (They don't have the sense god gave a cucumber)

They are usually the cheapest and, unlike eBay, you know that the item isn't a dodgy counterfeit.

amazon	Brian Jackett	2018-05-10T16:25:25Z	1	Today by chance I found out Amazon had switched on my Prime account charging me a monthly cost. I don't know how long this had been activated as it is impossible to check your bill. It is also impossible to contact Amazon to discuss the matter.So I am left but no alternative to say that I hate Amazon Prime and they have ripped me off. Why is there no alerting so that you know you are being billed.
amazon	Thomas Dunphy	2018-05-10T00:10:13Z	4	Amazon has a great site, although it has some bugs.  The biggest one I find is the sort button.  After the initial search for an item, several pages of results come back.  When you change the sort from relevance to price low to high, many times you go from many pages down to one page of results.
amazon	D.Taylor	2018-05-09T10:26:15Z	1	Amazon what has happened to you??Your company used to be brilliant, I used to buy everything off of your site. I pay for Amazon prime which was good for next day delivery. Now my purchases are lost in transit with your couriers all the time. Twice I’ve received a refund of two items I purchased which were damaged or lost and you informed me by email to discard of the item (which I did) now your sending me emails telling me to send the item back or you will charge my bank account. I have had to go to your CEO first time round and it looks like I’ll need to do same thing again this time round.
amazon	Mark Stevenson	2018-05-09T06:35:46Z	5	Thanks for all your hard work, I stopped looking for new shopping sites a long time ago! Never had any troubles with the orders. Keep up being the best in the industry!

amazon	Mark Bowman	2018-05-07T11:04:08Z	5	They are top notch for customer service, products, and delivery time. It kind of spite me when I purchased a new Chromebook, and being offered the extra Business Suite, thinking it was more of a must have than an elective, I purchased it. But again, some of that in fairness was my lack of knowledge of these Chromebooks, but it was the principal and it bothered me, as I never used the Business Suite, canceled monthly billing immediately. Amazon refunded the $10.60 to my card for the misunderstanding, and never using the Business Suite, I honestly thought this was a higher level of customer service, and couldn't be happier with the company.
amazon	Maria	2018-05-07T01:36:30Z	5	I love Amazon! Every time I've ever had a problem, they have came through and made sure to fix things the right way. Sometimes they've given me an entire refund and let me keep the item at the same time. I think every company should try to follow the standards that Amazon does. So far Im a very happy customer!
amazon	brnsn	2018-05-06T10:08:32Z	5	perfect customer service
amazon	DrDavidM	2018-05-05T00:34:56Z	2	Ok. They probably do deserve better than 2 stars, but I'm comparing them to what they were 2 years ago. It appears if you are not willing to pay them $120 per year for the honor of Prime membership, you are not worth waiting on. I have seen numerous items lately that are only available to Prime members. What? I can't buy something because I do not pay you an annual fee? I made a purchase on Walmart.com on 4/28. I received it on 5/2. I made a purchase at Amazon.com on 4/29. It's 5/4 and it hasn't even shipped yet. I'll make every effort to order from other vendors in the future.

amazon	Hudson Curlewis	2018-05-03T06:24:51Z	5	My 2-month old baby is in love with this mobile. At first, she didn’t really care for it. I think because her vision hadn’t fully developed yet. At about 6 weeks old, I noticed that she started to follow the insects as they turn. Now, she is starting to really enjoy it and is laughing as the insects turn.The mobile is small but it fits our pack and play. It is portable so we can transfer it to the car seat or the stroller. It’s inexpensive and worth every penny!
amazon	José Flores Sr.	2018-05-02T20:35:57Z	1	I was unable to contact them again after telling them of a package that never arrived. After they told me it will take them 3 days to find out what happened with the package asked that they send me info of their finding and now I can get to chat with anyone because it is a pain to navigate to anything that has to do with support the phone I had for customer support suddenly does not work anymore.

amazon	YC Kuek	2018-05-01T04:55:55Z	1	My parcel was lost. As I spoke to Amazon Customer service, they sent replacement and confirmed I don't have to pay again. After some time, I received reminder to return the order, otherwise they will charge me again. I checked with Amazon Customer service, they assured me I will not be charged. One day, I was charged over $240+ and as I did not remember this, I thought this was a fraud and called to suspend my credit card. As I recalled about this, Amazon Customer support apologized and refunded. However, as I was using foreign credit card, I had to pay $12 due to the currency buy in/out rate difference. As I complained to Amazon support, they only agreed to give me a voucher that can only buy Amazon brand products which is useless to me.
amazon	Svetlana	2018-04-30T21:07:40Z	1	"When you return an item that you've payed for with your amazon visa credit card -- never except refunds to ""gift card""! Because you will loose your 3% rewards (5% rewards for prime members) next time you pay with this ""gift card"" for another item."

amazon	paul	2018-04-30T06:43:13Z	5	For the prime membership is it worth the extra £79 a year. Thats a tough one. But i will say customer service is excellent. Ive had issues with several rogue companies selling dodgy products and obviously if its a company like ebay well you can wait months to get anything back if at all. Amazon deal with issues straight away, and refunds are instant which to be honest i love. Id rather pay a little more than subject myself to the hassle of chasing money owed with no back up what so ever, yes that would be ebay again. And dont get me started on paypal. Thats a joke. Billion dollar companies that cant be bothered to sort out a decent app that works on your mobile well is just well stupid in this day and age. The amazon app ive never had a problem with. Order, pay, print FREE return labels is a doddle. Ebay and paypal app are probably the worst things on my phone, way too buggy imo
amazon	Deven Davies	2018-04-29T19:25:02Z	5	Amazing care for their customers and always assuming the best. Package lost? They'll cover and replace it (so long as its a reasonable cost). Order the wrong thing? Easy return policy and replacement order. Overall, just a enjoyable company to do business with!

There was someone ready to help me this late a night on a Sunday. My issue was solved quickly, as they had me reorder my item and waived the shipping fee for 1-day shipping. The person who helped me also canceled my other order for me and is sending me an email when my payment gets refunded. My package is arriving today and I am so grateful to Amazon for helping me get my package on time.

Amazon confirmed I do not have a prime subscription, nor have any orders been placed since last year. They confirmed my card was not even registered on the account anymore. Spoke to 3 different agents who could not locate this transaction so could not help me, 2 promised call backs which I am yet to receive. I just want the £79 rightfully refunded to me as this is a unauthorised transaction and effectively theft, and no one at Amazon wants to take responsibility for it!

amazon	Alicia	2018-04-20T15:09:27Z	1	"Shocking service. If I could give no stars, I definitely would. My partner bought a Samsung s8 from Amazon with a Third party seller called ""Power Tech"". We bought the phone knowing it could be a risk, as the reviews were not good to start with. We ordered the phone. After one day already, we received an email telling us the delivery was delayed. With a bad gut-feeling, we waited another week. One week later, the delivery was (AGAIN) being delayed another week. Patient as we are, we waited. One week later, 2 weeks after buying the phone, the delivery was once again delayed by a week. That was it, we straight away knew it was a scam. Called up Amazon's customer service and spoke to a man with an extremely strong accent. The agent told us that Power Tech had left Amazon A DAY AFTER WE'D ORDERED THE PHONE. No one decided to maybe phone up the CUSTOMERS who had PAID 500 POUNDS FOR A PRODUCT. No apologies. We simply got a refund. As I was not satisfied, we rang up again to then speak to ANOTHER agent with a very strong accent. Hard to understand and very unhelpful. After we had given our explanation, he simply asked 'whats your email address?'. No apologies, no decent manners, nothing. Amazon clearly recruits agents based upon their robotic and inhuman skills. I insisted to speaking with a manager. The ""manager"" picked up the phone. Another person who was un-understandable. He claimed that they had done everything they could to help the situation. The person I spoke to, who was clearly incapable of any managing position or satisfying a customer, did not understand my story and said: ""we refunded you so I do not understand what the issue is."". This made our blood boil even more. I decided to hang up the phone as wasting time to incapability is not something I wish to be doing all day. No issue resolved. We have spent 3 weeks waiting for a phone that was never going to come. On top of that, we spent another week waiting to be refunded. Amazon: if you claim to be a market leading website, please sort out your business and make sure you work with reliable third parties. Plus, please employ humans who 1) can speak proper English and 2) aren't socially awkward to solve a bloody issue. Sort yourselves out."

amazon	Peter Overby	2018-04-14T23:11:27Z	1	Amazon prime is a fraud. After buying a 16 dollar thing of Amazon they took 90 dollars for a year membership for their Amazon prime. No notification no warning no nothing. Feel very uncomfortably with Amazon having my credit card info since they will take my money with no question asked!
amazon	Financial & Trading	2018-04-14T09:49:34Z	3	"Pretty good service so far, but plenty to improve on deliveries and comunication still.Have Kindle unlimited and although is decent you are not able to search only within subscribed books. And the ""unlimited"" label is misleading, most of the best books are excluded."
amazon	VaastheRetailer	2018-04-13T12:51:09Z	2	Ordered quite a lot of products with a couple of them and around 30% of them were faulty. That's way too much. Plus, when it comes to refunds the customer service only supports the seller. One more faulty product I get and I will finally say goodbye to you Amazon.
amazon	TJ	2018-04-13T12:43:08Z	1	Child sex doll?? Seriously?! You are sick!
amazon	Shopperholic	2018-04-13T07:08:23Z	4	Use it quite often, sometimes shipping takes time. Overall good experience. Customer support did not reply once.
amazon	Tony Pereira	2018-04-12T14:24:04Z	5	I only ever shop with Amazon I know I’m getting the products at a good price and with prime they come the next day. If you have any problems just contact them and they are happy to help.
amazon	Ryan Adams	2018-04-12T11:39:26Z	5	Five stars no doubt about it they just help us all way too much ....personally the affiliate program is amazing and I worked for them for a few years in Tennessee and it was a excellent experience ...very happy with Amazon
amazon	Gillardstunts	2018-04-12T09:56:45Z	1	Amazon Prime: I bought a hedge trimmer from Amazon, unbeknown to me there was a 30 day trail period for Amazon Prime, something I neither asked for nor wanted, I have just discovered they have been taking money from my bank account every month since, without my permission or without me knowingly agreeing to this. The only way I found out was when I changed bank cards and they were trying to withdraw from the new one. I looked on there web site in order to stop this, no help whatsoever. Utterly disgusted and will never use them again. Please check your bank accounts to see if Amazon are stealing from you too.
amazon	Albert Wong	2018-04-12T09:26:26Z	5	I have been an Amazon customer for a long time and I never had any problems with them. I had a few orders where the postal office somehow misplaced (lost all tracking information) on a package and Amazon shipped a new one within a hour of me calling them.Amazon may not be the cheapest, but I am willing to pay more for great customer service and a great RMA policy. I rarely return anything, but it is nice to know that Amazon will fix any problem I may have really fast. I am very happy with the company and hope to order more from them in the future.Albert
amazon	Sebas	2018-04-11T19:23:10Z	5	Can't complain about much. Been with them for years and their shipping only gets faster. Returns are a breeze.

amazon	customer natasha m	2018-04-10T15:52:39Z	5	Amazon is an excellent company to do business with. I bought an item from their website and needed to send it back for a refund. They gave me a refund before receiving the item. I have done online shopping with several companies, yet, neither of them has given me a refund as fast as Amazon. Great company and I will continue to do online shopping with them as long as I can.
amazon	d.c.	2018-04-10T14:35:40Z	5	they have the best customer service ever, it's one of my favorite shopping places
amazon	Geoff	2018-04-09T16:58:54Z	5	Used amazon a few times now via there app or website and the process is simple and always get a full breakdown and delivery schedule and well worth paying for the prime service as you get free next day delivery on lots of items and also prime tv .
amazon	Simon Hodding	2018-04-09T14:17:22Z	5	Probably the best way to get online productsYou need to become a prime member to get the best out of amazon Fast free delivery for all prime
amazon	XP	2018-04-09T12:15:14Z	5	I bought a backpack with Fulfilled by Amazon and encountered a problem with payment processing which resulted in 1 day shipment delay. (they accepted my payment method, but later rejected it. They could've rejected on the spot and I would've tried to sort it out immediately) This annoyed me because it defeats the purpose of me paying a premium for AmazonGlobal Expedited Shipping which values S$18.44. I shared my concern with Amazon customer support and they promptly waived my total shipping & handling fees of S$25.65 to S$0. I thought it was a courtesy talk-only customer service, but 5 minutes after the live chat ended, the change reflected. I was amazed. With this, it's enough for me to trust Amazon and shop confidently with Amazon.com in the future ^_^
amazon	Laurance Mendes	2018-04-08T15:15:18Z	5	For me Amazon have been superb on multiple ocassions.
amazon	CustomerJ Lamb	2018-04-08T09:02:02Z	1	Their help, when you are supplied with poor or faulty goods from a third party,  is terrible. Basically you are on your own, they won't even contact the supplier if it's after a certain time from purchase. Poor customer support.
amazon	L.K	2018-04-07T16:50:09Z	3	I pay for prime and its normally good but recently deliveries have gone missing or been broken they also have proved they don't check sizes from third party sellers as I bought an item listed as UK large and received Chinese large which is basically a UK small. Customer service have been shocking and rude.
amazon	Rebecca Lindsay	2018-04-07T00:04:45Z	4	I've had some issues with individual sellers on the website, but overall it's absolutely fantastic !
amazon	William Martel	2018-04-06T12:30:28Z	5	Never had any problems, mut maybe I'm just lucky
amazon	TrustPilot-ite	2018-04-06T09:57:06Z	5	WARNING:Just a word of warning.I've ordered lots of things from Amazon and only had 2 or 3 failures.  However, I feel that I should warn people that if your item is coming in from anywhere in the world, including Europe, customs randomly check items and if they are over just £18 in value, they levy a surcharge.  I've just been told that my item won't be released unless I pay £32.  The item itself was £52 and I paid £52 for delivery.  That means that costs have now exceeded the value of the goods.  Absolutely ridiculous.My options are to pay, or let the item be returned.  I have to add that I didn't buy this item off Amazon but when I told Parcelforce Coventry that I'd ordered high value items in the past with no problems, she said that I'd just been lucky not to have received a surcharge. Check where your items are coming from before you take the gamble.
amazon	Paul Walker	2018-04-06T05:05:36Z	4	I have to say, one of the few companies to truly impress. Not without the occasional issue but with a company of such sheer volume this is to be expected. The difference is, they do make a very genuine effort to solve fix and resolve.Good Job Mr Books
amazon	Fred M	2018-04-06T03:07:49Z	5	I've never had any negative interactions with Amazon.com itself. Whenever I purchase directly from Amazon my items tend to arrive quickly and in excellent condition. When I've spoken with customer service via live chat, my issues have always been handled to my satisfaction. The same cannot be said for certain sellers on Amazon. However, I won't name them here, as this review is for Amazon and not individual storefronts.
amazon	Natasha	2018-04-04T07:39:55Z	5	Excellent service
amazon	Margaret Gaughan	2018-04-03T14:45:03Z	1	Since making a complaint to Amazon regarding them taking double payments for Netflix, for months, they took this months payment and then disconnected my Netflix. No one at Amazon is able to deal with the problem
amazon	Dayna Swinbank	2018-04-03T14:33:25Z	2	Wary of ordering expensive items again.I had ordered an xbox one x, which was supposed to be delivered a Saturday which never turned up, however had been marked as signed for and delivered. I was waiting in all day, and had no knock on the door.Was then said to be delivered Sunday instead, however that never arrived. Was then told they would not give me a refund while it was under investigation. Many calls and complaints I eventually got my money back via gift card. Had to re-order and eventually got it the Tuesday.Then had a knock on the door, from their investigations team with the driver, who I had never seen. Just to explain again, there was never a knock at the door, I never signed for it etc. And the driver confirmed he did not remember the address.Never heard anything of it since and was not offered any good will gesture, despite the amount of hassle and upset they had caused, due to it being a present that was very late.Will still order low value items, however never expensive orders again.
amazon	taq	2018-04-03T13:31:15Z	1	Got sent the wrong product and contacted them. They told me its fine i can keep the product and they will refund. So i did and ate the nutella they sent me instead of the trainers. 1 week later and no refund. Contacted them again about the refund and they say they wont refund and i need to return. I told them that they sent the wrong product and sent nutella instead of trainers and now they want me to send the nutella back. When i was already told to keep the item so it was eaten. Useless customer services.  When i ask to speak to a manager im always told theres none available. I have been in touch 6 times since and every time there is no manager available. I wont be buying from amazon again and i hope that nobody else experiences what i have.
amazon	Adam	2018-04-02T20:32:35Z	5	Great company. Used them a lot for buying all sorts of different things since I was at university, which was a long time ago - good value and items always delivered on time. Recently upgraded to Prime and really pleased - the next day delivery service is fantastic.As for people complaining about customer service, the only issue I've ever had with an Amazon order was a Kindle that broke just over a year after buying. Despite it being just outside of the warranty period (which was 12 months), when I phoned up about it they gave me a replacement Kindle for free.
amazon	Pasha	2018-04-02T16:52:05Z	1	WORST CUSTOMER SERVICEALWAYS REPLYING AS ROBOTS!!!! DO YOU HAVE REAL AGENTS THERE OR NOT?? STOP DOING IT!!!!!!!!
amazon	Paul James	2018-04-02T14:25:48Z	2	I had an order dispatched last Thursday to arrive before 9 pm at the lockers at a petrol station which failed to turn up I was then told there was a Delay in delivery due to external factors it would be up to a week late and if not delivered by then to contact Amazon, I would not have minded but it was a Delivery By Amazon Shipping, so I have to report Amazon delivery to Amazon what a joke.
amazon	valerie	2018-04-01T21:55:26Z	1	Amazon's customer service is appalling in every way and a sad example of what happens when a company outsources customer care in favor of achieving additional profits.  In the past I would have championed Amazon but their service has so drastically declined over the last few years that no matter what the order, whether digital download or physical order, they seem to find countless ways to fail and are monumentally incompetent.  My favorite customer service story to date is the one where I contacted Amazon to inform them that I was being incorrectly assessed state sales tax and the agent, rather than removing the tax from the order, suggested that I try to find my item in a brick and mortar store to avoid the tax.  Other experiences have been less humorous and just downright frustrating, as I have been foiled time and again from actually completing or receiving orders.  I am now adhering to a policy where I just do not use Amazon unless there is absolutely no other option.
amazon	Phil Samuel	2018-03-31T16:55:49Z	5	Much better to purchase from amazon than ebay as the independent  reviews are so helpful of the products they sell.Delivery times are also spot on.

amazon	Jo	2018-03-29T00:07:51Z	2	"I used to like Amazon back in the day, free shipping would get your items shipped within 2 business days. Now, they're trying to force Amazon Prime down everyone's throats, and it takes 5 Business days to ship items you purchased that qualified for the ""Free shipping"" They're going to bring themselves down. I'm done shopping with them."
amazon	LYNNHBF	2018-03-28T20:52:09Z	1	Twice I have tried to post a review about a dodgy experience with a seller and Amazon have  refuse to publish on both occasions.  There is no offensive language in the review just poor fact about my experience. How is the customer to be protected against bad experiences if they are not made aware of the experiences of others!!!
amazon	Tiffany Jorgensen	2018-03-28T20:00:52Z	4	I love their customer service and return policies. THE BEST!

amazon	Fergus	2018-03-27T18:55:01Z	5	So I buy a lot of stuff from amazon. I mean loads and loads. The vast majority of the time, I get exactly what I’ve ordered, cheaper than most other suppliers and it gets delivered really quickly. Occasionally items delivered from China take a long time but the forecasts are quite accurate. However, I’m writing this review because amazon customer service seems to have massively improved. It was always ok, but was an email based system that was a bit clunky. Now they do an instant call back service and the policies seem very customer friendly. I had a sphero robot that I bought as a Christmas present that stopped working properly (it cost about £100). I called expecting a return it and we’ll see if it can be repaired. I was wrong! I was offered a refund or replacement - the replacement arrived the next day (I called at 3pm on a Saturday).  I was also emailed a free post label to return the faulty robot. Absolutely brilliant customer service.
amazon	Doğukan Adıgüzel	2018-03-27T15:54:15Z	5	It has everything I would ask for! Once, I bought tires from amazon. It was smaller than I would ordered. I contacted with customer service then they replied me very kindly and changed with bigger ones. I would recommend them to everyone!
amazon	Mindy	2018-03-27T06:07:12Z	4	The prices are not always the best deal, but ordering is simple and shipping has always been fast!  Items have always been as described.
amazon	Jewel	2018-03-27T00:59:11Z	5	I love amazon it has really good deals on everything. I like that my packages come quick. I love that if I have any questions or concerns the customer service people are really nice.
amazon	Bilal Latif Sheikh	2018-03-26T20:34:05Z	1	Im a prime member ordered a few items for prime delivery but still nothing and its been 4 days past the delivery date.
amazon	Kerry Parker	2018-03-26T11:06:46Z	1	BEWARE... AVOID . If you buy though amazon and the 3rd party seller says they have delivered the item and they haven't you do not get your money back... I have been waiting for 33 days holding on the phone, complaining to al different departments and still I have not received a refund...Amazon do not help their customers .... There is no complaints department.... No supervisor who cares to do anythingPlease AVOID....
amazon	unhappy	2018-03-26T09:10:49Z	1	Amazon.com ended price adjustments/matching. They used to do it but recently I tried and also was denied along with other I read about on a blog, will cancel my prime pantry membership. Jeff Bezos (or some position close) is responsible if what i read on this post is true as the policy came from the top. Any other company does honors the price adjustments. now my deal was with food, i have walmart.com jet.com boxed.com just to name a few, and i even mentioned this to a supervisor in chat and that by not refunding me the $.89 that i was asking for they may lose a customer. They don't care, Jeff Bezos is money hungry and as the richest man in the world, can't get enough. I'm done with Amazon, this doesn't hurt me much I can go to these other sites. It benefits me too as ive seen amazon 3rd party sellers charge outrageous prices on products, food and other alike. I've really had to spend up to an hour longer online shopping at Amazon lately trying to find the same or similar deals. It's time to get out of the Amazon and explore elsewhere people. lol but im not joking im done with amazon.
amazon	Jimmy Kerr	2018-03-25T18:19:38Z	4	Good , easy online ordering , site is well set up easy to navigate . Never had any problems with any deliveries and I've had hundreds usually delivered next day or not long after . Just avoid any products bearing their name and all is fine.
amazon	William Ellis	2018-03-25T14:09:09Z	3	Amazon allows an order to be cancelled before the order has been dispatched.  I ordered a phone case and then noticed it was coming from China and would be a long time arriving. I checked to see it hadn't been dispatched and sent a cancel request. When this was not acknowledged I sent three more. .A day or so later I checked my Amazon account to find it was just dispatched in spite of all my cancellation requests. Amazon now tell me I had only 30 mins to cancel the order even though it hadn't been dispatched for almost two days after my cancellation.

This has happened before, which is extremely frustrating as I had left detailed instructions on where to leave the package. They were helpful in refunding me which was very kind, however, I think they need to have better communication with their shipping entities.
amazon	Silvia solva	2018-03-21T16:57:53Z	5	Very good. keep the  work up
amazon	Paul	2018-03-21T13:20:16Z	2	I purchased an Item today - I Definitely 100% selected i did NOT want Amazon Prime, I did NOT choose free delivery with Prime - despite the best efforts of Amazon to force me to select Prime. I then received an email congratulating me on my new Prime Membership !!!. I then went to my account to cancel, I had to select and confirm Cancel THREE times. IF I WANT AMAZON PRIME I WILL SIGN UP FOR IT - I'M NOT STUPID. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF AMAZON SINCE 1997. I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEING TRICKED AND DUPED INTO SIGNING UP.
amazon	Dinez Carnay (Dinez Taxis)	2018-03-21T11:34:39Z	1	I called before and the lady told me that she would cancel the subscription for Prime and refund me, now, i noticed, i had been billed for the last three months!  I had to call them again and the contact information was very difficult to find!
amazon	Noel Gomez	2018-03-20T10:56:48Z	4	Very good, keep up the good work
amazon	Ellie22	2018-03-19T17:28:59Z	4	I've been a Prime member for several years now and I am actually quite happy with Amazon. Don't get me wrong, I have received a couple damaged or incorrect order fulfillments. However, on these few occasions, Amazon has corrected the error promptly with either a replacement or refund. No sitting on the phone arguing with a representative for an hour or waiting for a call back like I've experienced with other companies. I simply reported the issue online and it was resolved.
amazon	Megan Duffy	2018-03-18T17:45:14Z	1	It started out as a once in awhile issue but now it's every time I order from them and now I'm just done ordering from them. Screw me over every chance they got. Right now the thing I am most angry about is the $700 I paid for my HP360 laptop.  If you don't know what a 360 is   It's one of the laptops that folds all the way backward and can become a tablet. I bought it last August. When UPS delivered it, the box was partially opened and it loomed beat up. I wasn't even home to use it for about 3 months and I've used it a grand total of about 6 times!  It's gotten worse and worse every time I've gone to use it and this morning I try to use it - and NOTHING!  Nothing at all. Not a dam thing! It won't even load. I can't open a single ap and im freaking out. So I guess I'm going to call Amazon, tho I don't know why.  Whoever answers the phone will barely speak English I won't be able to understand them and vice versa. Then they'll tell me what I already know because I just looked it up on my phone and I tried to post a bad review on Amazon -  They're not even selling that computer anymore they won't allow me to post a review at all when I try to it brings me to my other orders instead and it says it's past the return and customer help date.  So something tells me I bought a lemon and THEY KNOW IT! I need this computer.  And I was so happy when I got it. It's red, my favorite color. It's just what I wanted...we work hard for our money just for them to steal it from us. I don't hate a lot but I really hate Amazon.
amazon	Charles  White Jr	2018-03-18T00:48:47Z	5	I have been a loyal Prime Member for 4 years now, and was an avid customer for many years before that. I have enjoyed my time as a customer with Amazon, and will continue on for many years to come.
amazon	Miriam Alvarez	2018-03-17T22:44:06Z	1	I was only a customer of Amazon and then I started selling. 2 different experiences in my opinion. As a customer it's fine but don't do business with Amazon if you're a seller. They will screw you over. I was trying to sell a product but decided I'd go with a different platform so when I submitted the return of the products from their warehouse, they ended up sending all of it to some stranger in another state. They gave away thousands of dollars worth of my product and I still haven't been compensated me for it. I just get those stupid automated responses from their help who apparently don't even know how the site is run and are of no real help since they are all outsourced workers. I'm planning to take legal action so I can get back what was taken due to their major screw up.
amazon	Robin L Wright	2018-03-17T21:57:55Z	5	I absolutely LOVE Amazon.  It's the best company ever.  From shopping, to ordering, to returning if necessary, they have the very best customer service I've ever encountered.
amazon	Paula Gordon	2018-03-17T16:14:11Z	1	I ordered Natures ocean coral base rock x2 (80lbs)  for my 125 gal saltwater tank. I ordered it on March 10th. Delivery date was March 15 to the 20th. My rock still  has not been shipped and it is now the 17th. I googled for the phone number because there is no way to contact them through the web site. I do not plan on ever ordering from them again. It takes too long to get my order. Customer service was rude, it made me feel like I was bothering them. They told me that my order was waiting to proses and would be shipped any day now, and to have a good day. I guess she was done messing with me. lol
amazon	Jon	2018-03-16T15:59:08Z	5	So easy to use and you can get anything on it.
amazon	Devan Nambiar	2018-03-16T07:39:25Z	1	I placed an order for a cryptocurrency wallet on 13th March 2018. Immediately after that I received an Order Confirmation followed by another email informing me that my account has been blocked and my order cannot be processed unless I send them my billing name, address and phone number registered on my credit card. Since their email did not elaborate what the issue was but merely asked for information on my credit card, I had to make assumptions on the possible problems and responded with the details requested with explanations. More than a day later, in response, I get another email from amazon asking me to log in to my account and upload my credit card statement. However, since my account was blocked I was not able to log into my account and hence I could not upload the card statement either. I sent amazon a note on my predicament and at the same time thought I might as well speak to their customer service consultant to expedite the matter. After searching their website for more than 20 minutes I could find neither a chat link nor a telephone number to call. I gave up.  Later in the night, it occurred to me that I could possibly find their customer service telephone number by googling it. I found it and called them only to get an answer that they will look into it and revert to me after a day or two! I have yet to hear from them.
amazon	Cara	2018-03-15T21:15:32Z	5	"I am writing both as a user of their products and also someone who has more than an inkling of ""how to be a professional seller"".

amazon	Nina Knowles	2018-03-15T00:27:36Z	1	I WAS GIVEN AN AMAZON GIFT CARD worth $100, WHICH I REDEEMED ON MY ACCOUNT SUCCESSFULLY. I TRIED MAKING A PURCHASE WITH IT ONLY FOR THEM TO PLACE MY ACCOUNT (ebuygoldtravels at gmail dot com) ON HOLD AND ASKED ME TO SEND THEM PICTURES OF MY GIFT CARD RECEIPT THROUGH FAX. I SENT THE PICTURE TWICE, ALONG WITH THE PICTURE OF THE GIFT CARD ITSELF. ONLY FOR THEM TO CLOSE MY ACCOUNT THE NEXT DAY WITH THE $100 GIFT CARD IN IT AND SENT ME AN EMAIL THAT I TRIED MAKING A PURCHASE WITH A FRAUDULENT GIFT CARD. A GIFT CARD WHICH I REDEEMED WITHOUT ISSUES ON THE SAME ACCOUNT. I HAVE EVIDENCE OF MY CHAT WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP JASPER, AND RECORDINGS OF THE PHONE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THEM BEFORE THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT. I AM GOING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THEM. THIS IS SO UNFAIR. STAY AWAY FROM THEM. THEY ARE WICKED
amazon	Gemini Fairy	2018-03-14T23:51:52Z	1	Three days Amazon has had my return but refusing to refund me. Don't know why. Calling my bank and filing charges against them. Don't know what happened to this company.

amazon	John Johnston	2018-03-13T22:41:13Z	1	wanted to purchase a simple psn digital code, first order didn't process because card details where out of date 2nd order with correct details didn't process, first order could not be cancelled, second order could not be verified because the first wasn't cancelled, then when i went to view where the codes are i could not log in, reset the password with email verification, still couldn't log in. took me nearly 20 mins to locate and access the well hidden contact details. Live chat representatives couldn't help me, a simple £10 transaction turned in to a 1hr disaster with no resolve. so much for convenience. the outdated site is difficult to navigate the order system is confusing and outright broken in places. the help staff are powerless to actually help. why are american company's so difficult to do business with, Head of amazon - richest man in the world - head of e-bay - facebook etc not far behind, how is this? these sites look like they are fresh out of 1995 invest some f**king money in your websites you absolute shambles

amazon	Bette Mckay	2018-03-12T18:44:16Z	3	I have never had anything negative to say about Amazon until this most recent experience.  I purchased a bunk bed online at a great price.  Well apparently it was priced incorrectly and they cancelled my order with out notifying me.  First I don't think it's best practice for a business not to honor their prices they list but Amazon covered that in their terms and conditions... but what about notifying me, that is mentioned in their terms and conditions?!!!  I ordered it several days ago.  Amazon's terms and conditions state that they will notify you.  Well they violated their contract.  I had plans for the bunk bed.  Now my granddaughters old beds will be picked up on Wednesday and they will have no bed!  Thank you amazon for not holding up your end of the bargain.  A purchase is a contract and I held up my end, they did not. Also they are not refunding me for 7-10 days so I can't even go to a store and buy a bed until they give me the money to.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with amazon.  And I have been an avid Amazon promoter and shopper for several years.  I will no longer provide them my business if they cannot operate with integrity and honor their end of the bargain.  Now my grandkids will be sleeping on the floor until I get my money! - Laura Sapp (269)491-1343

amazon	Every Jon	2018-03-11T21:37:24Z	3	Amazon can be a Great website for Online Shopping. Do have there Cons but the Biggest Con has not understood the Region Restrictions of Video Games, other things. As a Customer, it makes me unhappy not knowing all the details of something I'm ordering for myself.
amazon	MR Ben Blackledge	2018-03-11T17:46:29Z	5	Made order after order with Amazon can never complain and always manage to find our house which other companies often struggle with
amazon	Eric Plott	2018-03-10T17:43:50Z	1	"This company has disabled merchants for absolutely no reason; My family and multiple businesses are Jewish run, this is our story.  That is right, Amazon and Amazon Pay, are both anti Semitic company's. So, if you are jewish, as I am and my mother;  had her beauty salon on the Amazon account. They harassed her for ""Selling Drugs or Adult Services"", which was a major insult, as she was working on her new design for selling retail products for her beauty salon. Towne Plaza Hair studio has been in business for 29 years! I have been in business about ten years now and we both have never had a charge back nor refund. They have their User Agreements and every right to ""part company for no reason"", but the both of us followed every rule and guideline, they looked for anything they could discriminate against when doing their reviews. Our new site looks so nice and clean, so we will get to make money than ever and it is best to not put your money in company's that are this dishonest and hate filled. That is the one thing I want to really get through to people, when companies start out, they start from Humble beginnings; now this company was designed by elites to make it, so it would never fail. The royals use this to control what other LLC or Corporations are doing. They discriminate against small business owners, and don't want to give the little guy a chance, they are like Brokers and like getting loans from a bank. They shouldn't though, you should be given a fair chance to make money like the rest. They didn't like that my Mother made 700 dollars the first week selling her Certified and verified beauty retail products, which she gets from Sally's. So no, my mother and myself aren't selling anything illegal or anything that another company wouldn't sell. So, if you are a Merchant and you have a company like this, they are just as bad as Paypal and Square. The thing you must think about is sending your money to them for their services or even just the Sales tax fees. DO YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY To Bullies that scam people out of their money, if they don't like you, simply because you are Jewish. They let the both of us sell from our website, before they profiled and prejudged us for being a Jewish proud heritage company. You should be able to promote whatever Ethnicity that you are with your business, and even religious view, if you want. We don't encourage any spiritual belief system, but mainly a health promoting company. This is the other thing they don't like, because they rather you be sick and just go to the doctor and get on medications. So, they get write off's for cutting the throats of small businesses, who do sell or focus on healthier products. See, because they themselves want to keep the competition in their ballpark with the Mass Production corporations and LLC's. Even if your company follows every single rule and user agreement guideline, as the both of us did. My mother would email them and tell them that she sent in every piece of paperwork they would request, after making her jump through firey hoops. Asking for her ID, Social Security or EIN number, Bank statement after Bank statement, Proof of her business location, with Pictures of all of this, and just on and on. IT WAS BAD. They pretty much the both of us, were making money and freezing our account, so we wouldn't have access to our profits before they finally decide to close our accounts with NO APPEAL and Hold on to all our money for 180 Days. This is also ILLEGAL And the same thing that the other unethical frauds such as PayPal  & Square  are doing. They began to investigate us, by typing our emails into Facebook and this is where the prejudice starts. They will review you with Audits, simply if they don't like you or your company, because you are say Jewish by blood, then they will come up with some lie to why they aren't going to Reinstate your company. Either these auditor, special-mystery customers have too much time, or they are really doing a great job at taking the ease away from using their applications, that some company's require you to use. Say, you don't want to use PayPal or Square and in some circumstances you are forced to use this company. This is similar to Net Neutrality, but it is more like Sole Prop. Racism.Again, both of our Company's have been around longer than all these phony card processor company's and they can look up our 10/10 reviews, with no refunds or charge backs ever. This sort of stress for small business owners, and then freezing and holding profits from sales that you already processed and shipped out, can cause a small business to go under and completely sink. I feel that is the entire goal for Large totalitarian corporations such as this. They didn't want us to make money using their platform, we don't fit their specific qualifications, but we follow every single one of their rules and user agreements, we don't sell products that are illegal nor do activities that are criminal, but they truly are the criminal ones, for they are discriminating and hating with out cause. When you have a crystal clear record and no blemishes, its hard for them to come up with any excuses to how they aren't judging our company's for simply being Jewish. Since they want to turn us away,I would say out of respect towards another Hard Working, Honest, and Ethical Company, such as myself and my mother, and most likely many many more,this. Out of respect DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY EVER, TURN AWAY FROM THEM BEFORE THEY TURN YOU DOWN. If you already have Amazon Pay, Just be the Bigger and Better Person, since they are stuck up and arrogant themselves (Which is Unprofessional).Cancel your Amazon Pay or Merchant account, and find a real good business that knows what they are doing. There are many cart processor company's out there, and you don't need amazon for selling your products.They are far too overpriced and because they road run over company's like myself and my mother, they won't last much longer. This will all come back on them, so I hope they live up their extravagant Superior Entitlement role. Since they think they are a great company, Read other Reviews, I am not the only Merchant that has been mistreated and unrightfully and unethically discriminated and judged. This will come back at them right now. *If you need to sell your products, I would say go to a real company such as CLICK FUNNELS, and sell your products with them, so you don't have to cut your profits with a Unethical company like Amazon. Sincerely you will make alot more money with this ClickFun, and they have a university that shows you how to use it, and you will funnel far more customers than Amazon. This company will be taking Amazon out soon, because they do know how to be honest and ethical. They Would never judge a person for being Jewish and then make up a bunch of weird charges or accusations about you. For instance they told my mom that she shouldn't sell ""Drug Paraphalia or Drugs, or Adult Services and Products"". This was not funny at all, as my mother is a 67 year old woman that has been in business over 29 years and never ever sold such things. Very insulting and we are very baffled why they would even say such things in the email. If people want to know what the email said, just let me know, I can prove they actually said This.So again, we didn't sell anything that was Illegal, or against the law or against guidelines. We resell products that are Certified Organic and at Beauty Retail warehouses.So, how can we be doing anything wrong, if we both make over 20,000 Dollars in sales, when operating smoothly; but they can or will also shut you down, if you make less profits that this. This is also another form of discrimination. I don't usually do things like this, but this review is sacred to me, as I believe the world does need to know the true truth as it is unadulterated. Maybe Amazon is selling drugs and laundering money for sell services or products themselves. Who knows, I believe since they like to discriminate and misjudge people and company's, perhaps they have something to hide themselves. I know any company that freezes your account for 180 days, is already committing an illegal fraud, where they are holding money to draw interest off your profits. There is no reason you need to wait a whole six months,"" to make sure that you can cover a chargeback refund"". Problem is we didn't get paid and the customers got their product. You are left having to issue your client a refund and figure out how to process their order again. This makes you look unprofessional, when Amazon was the one's who made the mistake. Truly, if they are doing things like this, I am sure that at the top, they might be hiding another elaborate conspiracy, such as illegal activities, or maybe even Human trafficking or other Criminal acts. Maybe that's why they can't have such honest and enlightened people, it would mess up the dark things this company really stands for. Don't go with Amazon, Cancel Your Account; You don't Need them, that's the  smartest choice to do. I will also be making this public with the Media and many high up Networks I am affiliated with, that has over 2 Billion plus people and affluent business owners and other influential people. We will be making a blog about all these things and emails that went along with our Unfair and Illegal experience. I know most likely they will reply with some, ""This is our policy rules and guidelines, that we can part company for absolutely any reason"" post below this review. That is perfectly correct and you can, AND I can use the heavy influence and Power to sway people far from your Crooked and lying company.  I Guess it is true truth, what they say about when you get too big for yourself, you start becoming the bad guy's. I knew Amazon, when they started off as a company, they were very humble, honest and would never allow BAD to happen. Now, are they GOD?"
amazon	Lyst Customer D.A.	2018-03-09T16:49:21Z	3	I starting using Amazon about 2 years ago and found myself buying more and more out of convenience. Im a prime member which is the only way I would use this Company due to odd shipping and returns policys from their vendors. That said I have been very happy finding items at prices much lower than elsewhere. That said s couple of things that bother me -1. Reviews are a joke. They only publish positive or netural reviews. If you say anything negative they reject them. Ive written probably a hundred or more reviews and each time Ive said anything negative its rejected. So I no longer write them and do not shop as often as I did before. 2. Scammers are everywhere on this sight so be extra careful. Amazon does try to get rid of these disgusting creeps but they pop up daily.If something is priced too good go be true and its not sold through prime beware you may be getting scammed. I was shopping one day and ordered many items they all were in the too good to be true category but  at the time I didnt know. over 15 items were scams all but one or two were legit. The scammer will offer something very cheap you order it they debit your bank account and you never get it. They fake shipping tracking numbers so it looks like its coming so they can get paid but the merchandise never comes. Always check the seller if they are new beware..if they have negative ratings beware. Ive caught a few of them. They are shut down only to pop back up days later. 3. Recently I noticed an email thanking me for my order but I realized I never bought this item. I went to the sight and OMG yes it said I had purchased this 14.00 item paid with my CC. Guess what I nevet got the item I was charged for and Im sure I never Ordered it.The good news us Amazon did credit me with a full refund but....had I not seen this charge I would have been out thus money. Again buyer beware.4. Beware of fake merchandise everything from special shampoos to phone charging cords. There are zillions if sellers out there selling counterfeit goods,fake products that can potentially harm. Amazon is gigantic and can't possibly vet all the sellers properly so becareful read the reviews and look at the seller's % rate if it shows negative marks move on. My 3 star's are mostly for amazon hiding real reviews shame on you Amazon!!! I can understand and forgive all the rest because they do try hard to get rid of the scammers. But the reviews need to be published stop sugar coating them.

amazon	Alexis Nicole	2018-03-08T21:07:45Z	1	Even though Amazon has great items at a reasonable prices I would have to say that I wouldn't ever purchase anything from there. I tried before, I spent over $3,000 on items and didn't receive not ONE item. I was so mad and I didn't get my money back. I bought 5 phones, clothes, shoes, accessories, etc.  And I didn't receive anything.  I was so mad and when I called them they said that the stuff was shipped out a few days early. EIther the delivery guy stole my stuff or Amazon is pity.  EIther way, I will never purchase anything from there.

It was taken off because amazon deemed it ""biased"" as Mamie Van Doren and I follow each other on twitter.  When you like a STAR, you follow them on social media, I suspect.  But amazon does not allow it.  Odd."
amazon	SoundDept	2018-03-07T09:50:19Z	2	Ordered a hardrive and it stated that there were 2 in stock.Stated that it would arrive today and when I checked today it said that it was expected between 18-21st March. I got onto Amazon chat and asked why it was saying this when it stated there were 2 in stock. It was explained to me that they were out of stock when I ordered due to other people ordering before me. Why say that there are 2 in stock when they are out of stock? Managed to get my order cancelled and went elsewhere. Will not trust amazon again

amazon	Tabitha13	2018-02-23T19:35:08Z	4	I love Amazon. I do all my Christmas shopping there, buy many products I'd typically go to a regular store for as well! Reason being it saves me gas money and the nuisance of parking. Saves me time waiting in lines. Saves me time driving to one store after another. AND many times I get free shipping and the prices are just as good as in-store. I have rarely had any problems with delivery, usually super fast. Returns are not a big hassle. The only time I had an issue with returns is when it was from an overseas company the return shipping would have been astronomically high. I called an Amazon rep and they told me not to worry about the return and credited my account. The only thing I'm not nuts about is the high APR% for the Amazon credit card. I'm paying mine down as quick as I can and will close it after that.
amazon	John Macleod	2018-02-22T19:50:41Z	4	Amazon as a company fulfills a promise to customers in achieving standards and targets to ensure that items purchased are sent and delivered on time and moderately priced too,making a vast difference.

amazon	Sean Doherty	2018-02-20T21:04:36Z	1	Worst customer 'journey' and by far the worst complaints 'journey i've ever experienced in my life! I've called Amazon 5 different times since around November 2017 (now coming up for March 2018) to get a simple, easy fix complaint resolved but after numerous promises of call backs and resolutions I have't even received an email of acknowledgment let alone a call or resolution. Terrible service for such a big company. Out of pocket, been detrimental with no care or customer service from Amazon. Worst company ever! I've spent thousands of pounds over the years with this company but now I'm looking to cancel prime membership, tell everyone I know to cancel theirs and not use Amazon anymore. Useless staff!!
amazon	BiggJazza	2018-02-20T17:16:55Z	1	1 star because I couldn't give zero. Seller only partially fulfilled an order. Filed an A-Z guarantee claim to attempt to get my full order only to find the claim was filed under 'late delivery' NOT 'missing items'! Then, to add insult to injury, Amazon, at the seller's instruction want me to send the fulfilled part of the order back and the seller will provide a full refund. Unnacceptable, I want what was advertised and what I paid for and I thought it was my claim. Problem exasperated by offshore Customer Service and lack of English language skills. Even their supervisors are working to scripts and lack any power to act on their own initiative. Never again will I buy so much as a ping pong ball from these.
amazon	NB	2018-02-20T01:37:57Z	2	Like any auction site, you will encounter problem sellers and shipping issues.  However, Amazon's customer service is where the ratings drop.  It's obviously outsourced, so you immediately face a language barrier and wind up having to slowly repeat your issue several times. Representatives will make you promises (such as gift cards as an apology for messing up an order, or a refund of your shipping on a late item), and then just never put it into the system, so when you call to check the status, you're told the conversation never happened.  Also, there is no way to quickly report a seller engaging in fraud.

I sent them back but received the correct shipment like 2 weeks later. Needless to say I wasn't happy because I was going for a once-in-a-lifetime vacation to Hawaii and didn't have them for my trip.Stick a fork in me. (Added Later) As a result of my bad experience with Amazon I've been finding an entire new world of products and services. No more Amazon for me.

amazon	Veritas	2018-02-17T09:36:49Z	4	Amazon UK is another love-them-or-hate-them company. For me, they've always quickly resolved issues with products sold by them. The returns policy is easy to complete. The third party sellers may take longer but they too, in the main, tend to deal with matters sensibly. It helps to provide photographs.The review system is a good way to voice any praise and complaints and helps the future customer to judge for themselves, though I suspect many of the gushing reviews are false positives.I find the emails which provide updates of purchase, delivery, and the tracking particularly useful.The only problems I've had were with sellers from abroad and that's usually due to transport delays/lost in post or wrong product information. They seem to have a stock photo which can misrepresent the actual item. Their couriers have mostly all been pleasant. I've heard about the pressure they're under to deliver within a certain time and have tried to offer tips, none of which have been accepted!P.S. I'd forgotten about the packaging. Sometimes they go overboard with huge boxes and swathes of horrid paper for small items and other times, squash expensive items together with 'air bags' that have burst by the time they've reached you because the outer box has been squished. Once, the Amazon sealing tape wasn't stuck on properly which was surprising as it's normally impossible to pry off. So, minus a star.

amazon	Bakir Tubainah	2018-02-16T00:40:11Z	1	The strangest StoryI am a seller in Amazon UK. I sell some staff on Amazon for almost a year. They have very strange story in making money especially from the sellers: they set their fees even on the delivery charge which has no profit to the seller as it will go totally to a third party, the delivery company, and I kept emailing them and asking to review the case of including the delivery charge when calculating the fees and they kept telling me yes we will review it and get back to you and never . the last email is before four months. Really greedy and they do not think of the seller and consequently they careless about the buyer...as reducing the fees will lead to dropping the prices and making customers happy: they put more fees and the prices go up and the customers complain about the high prices and they do not know that we , as sellers, do not raise the prices...it is Amazon forces us to raise it by increasing the feesAnother strange case is that they force you with their delivery charges as long as you are in the individual plan to force you to move to pay them £30 a month to move to professional plan. HighAnother strange story: They keep the sellers money for very long time and when they transfer: penny by penny...I call the customers to check websites and check social media before buying from Amazon as most of the items are more expensive than the market and this is due to the high fees imposed on sellers.

amazon	Simon	2018-02-14T21:24:51Z	1	This has now happened twice. Bought some items via Amazon. An item breaks or is no good, so I return the item and get a refund. A few weeks later, Amazon then debits my card again for the item which has been returned! When I last phoned to kick off - I was told that the wrong return postage sticker had been attached - which is funny because guess who supplies the returns post stickers? You got it - Amazon! In other words, the excuse offered was complete B/S. Amazon staff are trying to get away with sticking through fraudulent bills/debits! Make sure you check your bank/card statements very carefully!

amazon	Jessica Monaghan	2018-02-14T16:18:08Z	3	I’ve always had fairly good experiences with amazon - it’s more the delivery services! Ever since they started cap amounts (so spend £20 to get anything delivered free) and then outsourcing delivery. Numerous times I have had deliveries marked as ‘handed to a resident’ when it hasn’t and is either lost of hanging out the letterbox for someone to steal!

amazon	J Dyab	2018-02-11T05:37:00Z	2	I set up a free seller account with hopes of trading in the future. Within a a short while they had charged my credit card multiple times for reasons unknown to me at the time, since the charges are hidden in terms I never even saw. I had to threaten legal action for a refund. A short while later I decided to sell something there....what a silly idea. You can't sell anything there that doesn't have a special code registered with Amazon, WHICH YOU HAVE TO BUY BEFORE YOU CAN SELL EACH DIFFERENT ITEM.R O F L . . .I need a wall...
amazon	Justin Clarke	2018-02-10T13:15:28Z	1	I have been using Amazon for several years and generally have been very impressed.  Recently however, they cannot get anything right - late deliveries, items which say they have been delivered when they haven't etc.  When you call Customer Services they can rarely help.  I will think twice now about using them.  They have clearly got too big to care about customer experience!
amazon	Sebastian	2018-02-10T10:51:56Z	4	I've ordered through this website a bunch of times and i've never experienced any problems doing so. Some of the products can be of lower quality but when you pay 5 dollars for a product that's normally much more expensive you can't expect anything else. Great site, great prices and decent delivery time. Big ups for Amazon.

In the past i was satisfied but recently one of my order never arrived, the other one came with fault and  after reporting it they never came back to my case. Once somebody broke my account and problem solving ended up after a long chat with Amazon with no solition so i had to block my credit card etc. A lot of troubles and headache with them.

Love the locker delivery option although sometimes my local one is full, perhaps they could increase the amount of places offering this. Shame they introduced the £20 minimum spend for free delivery. Customer services have always been quick to respond if I have had any issues and rectify things.

amazon	Joel	2018-02-04T15:44:47Z	1	In relation to Order # 205-8187368-2071530:On 18th December I placed an order with Amazon for around £250 worth of items using their Prime 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery service. The order consisted 11 different items (a range of toys and other gifts bought for Christmas to give to family and friends). Amazon in the past have been a very reliable and reputable company with exemplary customer service so I felt that this was a convenient and safe option to make sure I had everything arrive in time for Christmas. This, however, was the start of my Christmas nightmare.The following day, nothing arrived. This was not an issue however, as my family were not coming to visit until the following Saturday so there was still another 4 days left before it would present any sort of problem for me. On the Wednesday, 3 of the 11 items turned up. On Thursday, nothing. On Friday morning, I finally receive a phone call from my sister (whose address the parcels were due to arrive at) telling me she was starting to get worried as most of the items had still not arrived and they had to be ready and wrapped for the following day to give to my visiting family members who live in a different part of the country. Given the urgency of the situation, I decided to take a break from work and give Amazon's customer service department a call.I initially spoke to a member of their team who looked into the situation and found that the items had indeed not been delivered, but that it should be fine and they would most likely arrive later that day. I explained my situation to them and told them that essentially if the items did not turn up I would be stuck with nothing to give to my family to open on Christmas day. I asked this member of staff to look into the situation again so that they could absolutely guarantee this, at which point the line goes quiet and a few seconds later the call terminates. Not being satisfied with the outcome, I decide to call back again at which point I get through to another customer service agent who again appears to hang up the call. By this point I was getting very frustrated but given that I had no choice I decided to call them again.By this time, it was 3:00pm and I had already wasted around half an hour of my working day trying to sort the situation out. I then get through to customer service agent number 3, who I explain to that I haven't received my items - to which he replies that they will definitely arrive by 9pm that night. I then explain to the agent that I need this absolutely guaranteed as if they do not deliver the items by 9pm I would then not have an opportunity to go out Christmas shopping that day in order to replace the items they had not delivered. After some deliberation he agrees to go and double check for me, and, surprise surprise, he tells me that the parcels won't be arriving after all.By this point, I was absolutely fuming. I could not believe that after 5 days of waiting on their 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery and an hour on the phone speaking to 3 different people they were actually telling me they were not able to deliver my parcels. All of this given that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY to contact me and let me know what was going on. Had my sister not bothered to contact me, I wouldn't have even known until the following day (by which point it would be too late).Anyway, I continued my conversation with agent number 3 and explained that I was absolutely disgusted by their level of service and that my only option was to finish work early (costing me around £50 in lost pay), travel to the town centre and spend the rest of my afternoon/evening shopping for presents that I didn't have the money for (since I had already spent it with Amazon). The initial response to this was to offer me a £5 Amazon gift card and 1 month free Amazon Prime (frankly an insult given the situation). They then offer me a refund to which I tell the agent it does not compensate me for the situation they have caused and I would be making a complaint and closing down my account (which I have had for over 10 years and spent many thousands of pounds with them on). He then decides to go and speak to his manager, and agrees that they will still fulfill the order and I will receive the items in due course, and they will issue me a full refund (which would instantly arrive in my account) for the items not yet received. Although I was not happy about having to leave work and roam around the town centre buying presents, I felt this was fair compensation and the best they could do given the situation. We then end the call and I head out of work.I arrive in a very busy town centre and attempt to look for anything which may be suitable given the money I had on my card. I enter Toys R Us and grab some toys for my niece and nephew, head to the counter and get my card out to pay. I enter my PIN and find that my card has been declined. I then try again, but it appears as though there is no money in my account. I then leave Toys R Us (the time is now about 5:00pm) and head to the Cashpoint machine to find that my refund has not yet arrived. I go on Amazon's live chat and the person I speak to tells me that the refund will arrive in 5-7 working days. Desperate, I call one of my friends who agrees to lend me £50 (not exactly enough for 8 gifts but better than nothing). I then spend my evening around town buying anything I can so at least there is something for my family to open for Christmas (aware that the items should arrive later on and I could always try and post them later).Christmas then comes and goes without too much bother. It comes to my attention in the first week of January however that the items had still not been delivered, so I decide its time to give Amazon another call. I get through to a customer service agent, and after saying a few words the call hangs up, so I call back again. I then get through to another agent who explains to me that my refund has been issued. I tell him that I have received the refund but I was still waiting for the items, for which he says the items had been returned and would not be sent out again. I then explain to them that I was still supposed to receive the items as per the agreement I made with them on the 22nd of December, to which he replies (surprise) that there are no notes on the system to this effect. He agrees to raise the issue with a manager for it to be investigated and I would definitely receive an email back about this in 5-7 days.2 weeks later, I still have no email or items, so I call Amazon again. After calling them three times and being hung up on and spending around 45 minutes on the phone I am finally put through to a supervisor. They tell me again that there is no notes on the system and there has been no investigation into my case. This time, I am promised a call back the following day at 5:00pm once the investigation has been done. I sit next to my phone at 5:00pm the following day but do not receive a call. I then check my Amazon account to find a message sent saying that they 'weren't able to reach me' and they were sorry that I was 'misinformed' that I would still receive the items. They tell me I should call back again for more information about it.I can tell you I have now given up trying to deal with their shambolic customer service team. The entire experience has been absolutely disgraceful and they should be ashamed of the way they have treated me as a longstanding and loyal customer of 10 years. I am now going to be closing my account with them and I will be posting my experience on every major review site online as well as telling all my friends and family. Amazon has embarrassed me at a supposed happy time of year and they don't seem to give a monkeys about their customers anymore. I will now be reporting them to the Advertising Standards Agency regarding their false advertising claims and I will be speaking to BBC's Watchdog about my case.I HAVE FULL EVIDENCE FOR ALL OF THIS BUT IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS WE CAN POTENTIALLY WORK TOGETHER IN HOLDING AMAZON TO ACCOUNT ON THEIR FALSE CLAIMS AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Full price only.Chatted to customer service, fobbing me off saying the promotion is nothing to do with them and I need to email Amazon Mastercard!Can take upto 48 hours for a reply.So much for £10 off this order. Disgusted with them.
amazon	Victor	2018-01-31T14:22:12Z	2	The delivery was quite slow for my parcel, which was delivered by i-parcel. It's been shipped since 3 weeks ago, and really frustrating because I haven't received it.
amazon	brett bryceland	2018-01-31T14:02:21Z	1	"If i could give this less than one star then i would. Amazon prime delivery and their customer service is literally the worst thing i have ever come across. Anyone living on a new build house in the UK should just forget about this service. In the past six months i've had items not turn up with the excuses of ""couldn't find address"", ""attempted to make delivery but no one home"", ""items successfully delivered"" and no sign of a package anywhere.Their customer service say the same thing and make the same excuses every time, useless to the core and couldn't organise a delivery if their lives depended on it!!"
amazon	Stephanie Joyce	2018-01-31T13:54:32Z	1	I am disgusted at Amazon. I but a lot of products from them and have spent thousands of pounds buying items from them.In December I bought a watch for £44.99. a couple of weeks later there were moisture droplets in the screen of the so called water proof watch. I got online, spoke to a customer service member who said they would give me £10 back because of this. I said, and have emailed proof that I asked, 'will this affect me if it stops working at a later date. I do not want to return the item and have a replacement now as I will lose my data, so I will accept the discount ONLY if it stops working at a later date I can get a replacement watch'. I got told this is fine. I asked for confirmation again, if I accept the discount, they will still replace it further down the line. I again got told this would be the case. A couple of weeks later, it stops working, my steps are no longer being counted on the watch. I get back online, advise of the situation, get told sorry no you can't have a replacement. I quoted what I was told, again, no they won't replace it, but I can pay the now increased price of £79.99 for a new one, they'll give me £30 off the new one, and then when they receive the broken watch, they'll give me another £34.99 off. I said it wasn't good enough, I just want a replacement. I'm then passed to a manager who tells me the same thing. I was on the chat for two hours, and no one offered a solution. I then asked for a managers phone call. Over an hour later I had a call. At first they were not going to give in, then finally they said they'd make a special exception and would send me a new one if I can return the broken watch. No problem. I was angry at being on the phone and taking out over three hours of my day on this. The return label comes, I print it out, take it to the only place I can return items, and they don't accept this kind of return. I tell Amazon, customer service online assistant says no problem, I will have someone come and collect it. Next thing is I get another returns label, exactly the same. I leave it, awaiting the call I was promised. 8 days later, nothing. I then have to call again today to say no one has called. turns out I was given yet more false information. No one was instructed to collect it and they are about to charge my account because I haven't returned the watch. Now I've been given a Royal Mail tracking return label to print out and take to my local post office. So yet again I have to take out even more time to return their faulty item. Not good enough. I've spent over 5 hours online and on the phone about this, made a wasted journey to return it, and here I am expected to go somewhere else to return it for them. Every time I ask to make a complaint I get fobbed off, told they'd give me a months free prime. I'm not interested in having free prime, it's a waste of time, I won't be renewing this year or buying anything more from them.

amazon	Darrell Kornegay	2018-01-29T18:06:55Z	1	PLEASE TAKE CAUTION!!My wife and I have been a prime members for a couple years now andhave trusted our credit card information with Amazon, until recently!My wife switched banks and forgot to click on her new debit card to be her preferred method so when it came time to renew our prime the old card was declined. NORMALLY when a situation like this occurs the company sends out a message to let you know if the payment is not made your account will close by such and such date. NOT AMAZON, they took it upon themselves to use another card associated with my account, one that had a different name attached to it as well and they used my company card without prior authorization. NOW, I often use my company card to purchase items through Amazon, but even I have to submit a requisition and get prior authorization before using. NOT Amazon, they will use ANY card they wish to.When I called customer service they offered to refund the money to my company card, but they wouldn't call my boss to explain the false accusations of stealing company money and Amazon seemed to not want to see it as illegal to use any card they want without prior authorization. I tried to explain to them their system of going about this is wrong and that I hope no one looses their job.AGAIN, this is a terrible and illegal way for a company to operate so please BEWARE!!I hope they change their system in lite of this

Amazon Prime sweetens the experience even more...with super fast shipping for items ordered, Amazon Music, and Amazon Video, I have found to be Amazon Prime to be an incredible value, even with the recent price increase.I do believe that the pricepoint for Amazon Prime is critical to Prime's success and hope that they will work hard to maintain it at that price level for maximum members and benefit to all.

amazon	Florin L	2018-01-22T15:06:02Z	1	Very bureaucratic, scripted answers that do not apply to my case and basically a poor attitude rooted in “we’re too big so one customer doesn’t matter”. You have the option to review third party sellers but not Amazon. Cheaters!  But they are already ingrained in our culture.

So friendly, fast and convenient. The prices they charge are amazing. Their refund policy is the best compared to any other retailer (including Costco!)
amazon	Agata Trafna	2018-01-21T19:27:22Z	1	I signed up for Amazon prime free trial but since I was not that keen on it I have cancelled my membership to ensure I will not get charged. Recently I have checked my bank statement and was charge for amazon prime membership. I have checked my amazon account which confirmed that I am not amazon prime member anymore. When I have contacted them, they advised that this was charged by amazon.com and that they have charged me. I had to get in touch with amazon.com who just advised me that i can cancelled my membership, failed to advise why They have charged me (including non sterling transaction fee). When I wanted to complain and escalate this further I have been advised that Amazon has no complaints department. When I asked who are they regulated by with respect to the payments they take, their answer was- I don't know. God knows what other countries I am going to be charged for.
amazon	Ovi md	2018-01-21T13:22:49Z	5	I always check Amazon first. They normally have the best prices and the quality is usually very good. It is so convenient to shop from home and avoid the crowds and the traffic and have your products delivered right to your front door. If you don't like something they have a great customer service and will accommodate you with the return and refund. Can't say enough good things about Amazon
amazon	Tereza Novák	2018-01-21T13:13:52Z	5	Great Srvice. Great Support.I will keep buying there!
amazon	customer	2018-01-21T12:47:28Z	2	Beware, if you have a problem or want to return an item with a seller, Amazon will not help you!
amazon	Hong Ha Nguyen	2018-01-18T20:45:01Z	4	Super Fast shipping if you have Amazon prime membership and variety of choice.
amazon	enc	2018-01-18T17:54:10Z	5	Hard to review amazon as a company, they've become too global. Overall for customers they are great, number of reviews and feedback they generate is unprecedented. Wish them all the best, just maybe allow a little less of really cheap stuff on amazon.com - that's be important.
amazon	diabrou	2018-01-18T15:59:33Z	5	the best. Delivery on time. Excellent
amazon	Chukwuma Okeke	2018-01-18T13:10:56Z	3	My favorite company. My challenge is that they are holding my over $200 of gift card. They said the card is invalid. How can a card I bought be invalid after using some part of it?
amazon	InMit	2018-01-18T13:05:41Z	4	It is very convenient to shop with them. A wide range of products +++
amazon	Clint T	2018-01-18T10:12:35Z	5	Similar to the UK counterpart. Not once had an issue, always arrived on time, and in the most part, early too. I occasionally shop on Amazon.com, usually for some US Goodies, that are hard, if not impossible to find in the UK. Price is usually pretty decent too, even if it does include an import fee. My most recent purchase was some Takis Fuego, which I fell in love with back in 2016, so had to get me some more of those ;)And like I said in my Amazon.co.uk review. Good Show Amazon! Not bad for an online Bookstore ;)
amazon	Daaimah Vazquez	2018-01-18T02:28:28Z	5	I LOVE Amazon! Its my go-to-place for online shopping and inspires new ideas. Even if I just think I need something, I quickly go to Amazon.com find the product, matching comparable prices, research reviews, and have it scheduled for a quick delivery! Amazon.com really came in handy when I had transportation issues with my car, it was life-saver many times over. It first website I go to for anything.
amazon	Charlotte	2018-01-17T20:44:26Z	5	Bloody love amazon! Especially prime 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
amazon	Rose	2018-01-17T07:22:22Z	4	I've written one previous review on Trust Pilot rating Amazon and gave them one star due to my experience. However, after ordering two pairs of boots and then returning them I am giving Amazon 4 stars because the boots arrived in perfect condition. Due to being unsuitable for me I returned them and found the experience very good. I would have given 5 stars but I great difficulty finding  the phone number to contact Amazon. When I did find it I clicked on and they phoned me back which was very good.
amazon	Mike	2018-01-16T23:37:08Z	5	Great Service.I usually used this to order online. They deliver on time and without any issue
amazon	Jon	2018-01-16T12:44:27Z	4	Good products at great Value.Always arrive in a timely fashion, and are well packaged, I  recently purchased a graphics card that arrived quicker than even i expected. So happy with my purchase.My only reason for 1 star less is that I feel they could price their charged deliveries more fairly depending on the type and size of products in question.
amazon	Daniels S.	2018-01-16T05:26:58Z	5	Greatest customer-centric company on the planet.
amazon	Alan Johnson	2018-01-15T18:23:37Z	4	Great service, i like the one day delivery , very fast.
amazon	Samer	2018-01-15T17:57:47Z	1	Worst company ever, you receive wrong orders most of the time, if not fake brands coming from strange countries. Also they indirectly subscribe you to their prime service without you acknowledging. And suddenly you receive a bill on your credit card that you never approved initially. Sneaky way to get your money.
amazon	D R	2018-01-15T08:34:19Z	1	I've been forced to write this review on Trustpilot because after much searching I can't find a way to review Amazon.co.uk AS A SELLER. Their web site only allows you to post seller reviews for Marketplace sellers. Anyway, just after Christmas 2017 I bought a copy of Origins: Wolverine on blu ray which came with a digital copy on a DVD. I usually buy media discs from Amazon rather than Marketplace sellers because up to now I've trusted them. First off there was a delay in its delivery even with Prime. Second, the product received came in a cardboard sleeve which was badly damaged. Third, the plastic case was not wrapped in cellophane (which new products should be). Fourth, on inspection the blu ray had a few scuffs on its surface, but the digital DVD was an absolute disgrace and clearly not new. It had sticky finger marks all over it together with even more scuffs. I waited until I'd watched the blu ray before posting a review - it was fine - but then felt that people need to know about this type of issue. I tried posting comments in the product review but Amazon refused to post them. I didn't want to contact Customer Services because I want seller comments to be in the public domain. After all, why should Amazon be 'immune' to seller feedback when Marketplace sellers aren't? Anyway, that's why I've posted my comments here.
amazon	Barry Hendricks	2018-01-14T05:24:22Z	5	Prime is recommended.
amazon	Ryan E	2018-01-13T09:36:06Z	5	Love the Amazon prime and TGT, keep it up.

amazon	Sarah Van	2018-01-11T01:23:23Z	5	I love you guys! Just please use UPS or FedEx instead of USPS bc USPS makes delivery such a pain for customers.

amazon	Heather Simpson	2018-01-09T14:00:09Z	4	Amazon are really exceptional, for the most part; they have the largest database of products, and their shipping time is legendary. The customer service could improve in other areas though. I once had to hustle to get a follow-up update on my order. It was a little infuriating.
amazon	Galle	2018-01-09T10:06:37Z	2	I am waiting for my command since one month, nobody kept me in touch I have 0 news from my products.It was supposed to come before Xmas...
amazon	Dan ventress	2018-01-07T21:53:16Z	5	Love amazon prime it’s such a pleasure to order a product and have it in your door next day they have never failed to keep that promise I recommend this service to anyone
amazon	adil valli	2018-01-07T16:11:46Z	4	fast delivery good quality products good company easy to use website
amazon	John King	2018-01-07T11:43:52Z	2	I've ordered many times from Amazon without a problem. However, when something goes wrong Amazon is very poor at rectifying it. I recently returned a £95 pair of defective Clark's shoes and received notification from Clark's they received them. Two months later and having had 6 different people from Amazon respond to my emails, I'm no further forward in getting my money back. My tip is to only purchase things from Amazon where there is a low probability of needing to return it.Once they have your money it's hard to get back!
amazon	Riya	2018-01-07T10:07:57Z	5	Great service anywhere in the world.I have sent gifts to friends in different countries and I am happy with their service.
amazon	Lumarie Vega	2018-01-07T03:17:23Z	1	They recently change their Customer Service providers to the worst. I have been a Prime Member a very long time and the one time I needed support all I got was misleading information and no information on shipping or estimated delivery but fast to charge my credit card with the amount! No representative has been able to help in the process and all of them end up with the same answer (template based). Really regretting my Prime Membership right now, not worth it!
amazon	Hopstimop	2018-01-06T09:37:47Z	5	Always on top.Amazing customer support.

amazon	majinfeyd	2018-01-04T22:31:47Z	4	Generally I like the quality of the merchandise I recieve here, you really get what you pay for and for a lower price than anywhere else on Amazon.com .  However, I do wish their Prime membership would be a little bit more consistent than it is with me.       I usually do all my Amazon.com shopping with my Prime membership and supposedly I am supposed to receive my goods within 2 business days but I usually do not, I receive them within 2-4 business days and in my eyes that is unacceptable.  I think for the price I pay for Prime I can live with that turnaround time but if a business says something and they advertise the living Hell out of it and everybody is expecting it, why can't they DELIVER IT then?  I'm just sayin'...     Their website is one of the most intuitive, user-friendly, cute and professional-looking websites I have seen on the Internet.  I can't honestly think of any other website that is better to look at than Amazon's.  The use of color, the way they place their buttons, the overall GUI interface... all top-notch.  I have rarely had to contact customer service about an item and I have never returned an item here, it is truly a well-oiled machine.  I have 350 reviews of items on Amazon.com and counting ( I am a professional reviewer ).     Amazon.com is the best website on the Net and deservedly so.  There is NOTHING out there like it!
amazon	Önay Burak Doğan	2018-01-04T21:38:27Z	1	We bought the futon sofa (DHP Brent Futon, Grey Linen) for 158 plus tax without looking the reviews unfortunately. Many of the buyers claim that foundation of one of multiple legs were not strong enough and broken while assembly or even before it is assembled. So like other buyers, one leg of our sofa is broken within a month or two. I contacted amazon customer service and they opened a return case. UPS guy came to my apartment saw the sofa and told he cannot pick it up because it must be packed. I never thought of keeping the box of a sofa, would you? Would you keep a huge box in a 1 bedroom apartment? Also why should I bother to dismantle a sofa for hours? I have some things to do while trying to feed my family on a graduate student salary. So I asked amazon to refund me directly or send someone to fix it or take it or whatever he wants. At the end, I have paid almost $180 to a sofa I could only use for 4 months when I was expecting to use it for a couple of years at least. I deleted all my credit cards from the website and I will cancel my membership.
amazon	Colin Crane	2018-01-04T11:17:06Z	2	"One of Amazon's third party sellers is ""Electrical Emporium,"" seemingly a trade name of Powerforce Distribution Limited.Despite receiving an email from the CEO stating all the usual ""bumph"" about how pleased he was with me buying a product from his company..... and if I have any concern in the future....... His employees cannot put the correct label on the appropriate product: I ordered a Vax vacuum cleaner. What did I get, a steam iron!I have no complaint with Amazon ""per say"" other than they immediately refunded the money and told me to keep the iron. However, that didn't help me purchase a particular model Vax vacuum cleaner, that I spent many hours considering against other makes and models to suit my wife and I using, as ""senior citizens"" with cats and dog fur to clean up etc.Now, I receive an email from Electrical Emporium asking me to return the product using the pre-paid label!!! What product? The one I didn't receive or the iron that Amazon told me to dispose of?Hello? To those it may concern, does any party talk to the other?I give up!I shall just ask Amazon and Electrical Emporium to read this review. Perhaps they will at least understand the problems I have and now face."
amazon	Nieuwenhagen	2018-01-03T23:27:16Z	1	1st item was delivered but was broke due to bad packaging. Refund asked from Amazon. Never received it.A 2nd item was never delivered at all. Also refund asked but this was not paid. After checking my order history I can't even trace the original order anymore. Removed from Amazon system. Not understandable.I don't trust this company. Will terminate account and never come back.
amazon	Stephanie Plumeau	2018-01-03T20:59:12Z	1	"I have been a loyal customer of Amazon for years. I had been told my showtime subscription was canceled when in reality it was not. I had been being charged for a year. I chatted in asking for a refund. After MUCH trouble I finally agreed to a promotional credit and a refund. I was told my refund would appear in 3-5 days in our account. After this time frame had come and gone, I chatted in again. I was told that due to ""technical difficulties"" my refund was not processed and instead would only be getting a promo credit. This is unacceptable and I was not even notified of this change. Furthermore, they lost the chat transcript of when I was promised the refund. Luckily, I had it emailed to me so I was able to provide it to them. Overall, I was tossed around the chat from rep to rep. All were less than willing to help. I was treated worthless and it is unacceptable for a company to treat their customers with broken promises and such rudeness."
amazon	Customer	2018-01-03T16:10:33Z	3	While there are advantages in shipping and price to being an expensive ($99) Prime member be prepared to be treated like a number. If you ever run into a problem that is not simple they will either be unwilling or unable to help you. I was a big fan until I found this out. They are too big, we need competition. I recommend giving some of your business to Jet.com and others.
amazon	Kevin Fletcher	2018-01-03T11:11:59Z	4	Good customer service, had no issues so far (fingers crossed)
amazon	FountainOf Light	2018-01-03T07:46:14Z	5	Gosh, I never thought I would give a retail giant 5 stars. Okay, I am not saying I haven't had issues with the product being cheaply made, or not matching expectation, or sellers, and I almost ALWAYS have problems with the mail carriers (especially USPS).  I AM saying Amazon (I do have Prime) has the best customer service regardless of your issue or who you purchased it from, that I have ever experienced.  I have had one issue in the several years of buying from them with a thoughtless package where a book was just thrown in and was torn to shreds (not literally but very close to literally) and it was THEIR fault. However, it was so easy to return that it was HARD to be upset (although I was because it was a last minute Christmas gift that I couldn't give and that left me with only one small thing. However it was my fault for waiting, I was moving at the time, and it was so preventable). I was quickly calmed down by their customer service rep, and they made it so easy. Of course the UPS guy never showed up the BOTH times Amazon scheduled a pick up but again that's my mail carriers I have to put up with. Ugh. Anyway, after a long pointless story, my review is just saying I really, honestly, just really do love Amazon.
amazon	Aaron French	2018-01-01T14:47:47Z	5	Always think I’m going to shop somewhere else but amazon makes it way to easy. With quick shipping it’s almost as good as going to the store for instant gratification.
amazon	for your order	2017-12-31T19:30:29Z	1	BEWARE!   When I ordered from Amazon, they OPENED credit cards in my name. Two banks confirmed Amazon opened these credit cards. In addition, Amazon sells its customers information.   After ordering from them once, I received multiple offers in the mail generated by Amazon. Will not allow Amazon to compromise my identity.
amazon	jaredj	2017-12-29T22:46:51Z	5	I’ve never had a bad experience with amazon. If something I ordered didn’t work, they made sure it was returned and replaced or refunded. Best company to date.
amazon	Poul Simonsen	2017-12-29T09:39:13Z	1	NEVER Again. And you can't get help
amazon	Zoe	2017-12-28T18:53:07Z	5	Always delivered on time - if not early. Great prices and helpful team to resolve any problems, received a refund within about 2 days. Always a fast process as a whole.
amazon	BaldTun4	2017-12-28T13:04:22Z	5	I have no Idea how anybody has given amazon less than 5 stars. I have never had a problem with amazon. They even refunded me for a Vape I had used and stored away for months because I had broken it. AMAZING COMPANY IN EVERY WAY
amazon	Carole Willis	2017-12-28T12:11:58Z	5	This is the most professional Company I have had pleasure of dealing with!!!.They have everything you want, they are quick, very reasonable in their prices, the packaging is always perfectly wrapped!!!.I use Amazon all the time and I have prime so usually I receive my parcel the next day!!!Well done!!!!!!
amazon	Gemma Morrison	2017-12-28T11:02:33Z	5	I think amazon is brilliant they sell everything at great prices and delivery is always on time and if there is a problem they always sort it there and then no messing about :)

amazon	Alberto	2017-12-24T11:26:42Z	5	Their CS experience is simply the best. Totally understanding and helpful.They got to this point because they're clearly customer focused.Prices are great. Some times they're not the lowest ones but I prefer to order from amazon because they allow you to return them without any questions.
amazon	devender	2017-12-24T04:18:10Z	1	I never bought any thing from this site in past. i tried once and regretting now. So lazy people when it comes to serve. I would not recommend this site. Post sale service is very bad. i wont give this site even a single star. Unfortunately no way to pass comment without adding star.
amazon	Vikas	2017-12-24T04:13:10Z	2	Bad experience never getting my orders on time

amazon	Molly Schleede	2017-12-22T16:27:01Z	5	"We always use Amazon. Never have an issue. Ordered some last minute items some stating they wouldn't arrive in time. Thankfully we received an email that they will. They always exceed our expectations. Never have an issue with customer service (kids purchased amazon prime on our Roku like 6 times, and after calling and explaining the situation to the customer service agent, they fixed it every time! Always laughing at the situation), and I will add this, my mother bought a gift from a private Amazon seller. The woman did not send it ""in time"" and when it showed up, a wonderful note, and extra gift was included. It was very sweet. Love shopping at Amazon, and will continue to do so!  Thank you Amazon!"
amazon	stuart mclean	2017-12-22T09:35:53Z	1	Well done Amazon,  my sons Christmas gift will not arrive in time for Christmas even though it stated in stock and delivery before Christmas when I ordered it.Once again well done.
amazon	Danny Peters	2017-12-22T06:38:52Z	3	Really requires patience to wait for the item to arrive at your doorstep!
amazon	David Cannon	2017-12-21T20:52:46Z	1	The most appalling customer service.  A gift voucher I bought had been redeemed by the time Amazon had sent me the email to say it was ready to be accessed on my account.  15 calls and 9 emails and still not resolved.  Each time I have had to explain, put on hold and then after 10 minutes the call is then disconnected.  I then email and they say to call....I then call and told to email.  Even ring backs put you through an IVR and are treated as fresh calls.  Ultimately the gift card was redeemed before Amazon sent me claim details and therefore is their risk.  Worst ever customer experience.
amazon	Alex	2017-12-21T11:44:48Z	5	I am a seller on Amazon UK, and I have to say that Amazon really does value the customer. Any returns or problems are always charged to the seller even if it isn’t their fault, but as also a customer I can say that this is great as problems can be sorted quickly and cheaply. I will keep on selling and buying on Amazon forever. Thank you Amazon!
amazon	Vito	2017-12-21T07:43:57Z	1	I did buy 3 Christmas presents the 6 December to be sure to get them in time, they wrote me that I would have get them the 12 but today the 22 still got nothing. Amazon dont  promise things you can't achieve Tx.
amazon	Eric Lambert	2017-12-20T18:11:51Z	1	I am very disappointed with Amazon.  I placed an order on the morning of December 14, 2017.  As short-time ago, the order had not been even processed.  I cancelled the order.  Amazon should have notified me that the order would never arrive by December 24, 2017.  They did not.  I had to check on the status of the order myself.  I am also trying to cancel my account with Amazon and they make it very difficult.  I ordered a short-time ago the same items from Best Buy, and the items, which cost the same as Amazon, will be ready for me to pick up at a local store this evening.  I do not recommend Amazon.  There are other better options than Amazon.
amazon	Donna Houguez	2017-12-20T15:33:06Z	5	All Christmas shopping purchased online. Absolutely everything arrived when they said it would and in great condition. I allowed a bit of extra time for delays as I assumed it would be a bit hit and miss at this busy time of year but it wasn't needed! Great communication about it all too. Very happy shopper :)
amazon	Zatoichi	2017-12-20T14:24:29Z	2	AMAZON why are you still using ARAMEX to ship to your international customers ? If you have any concern whatsoever for your international customers you would immediately switch to a proper reputable courier.It is obvious ARAMEX couldn't care less about having you as a customer, so why persist with this useless company ?  Their deliveries are constantly late and there is zero communication / feedback from them to the customer. I know you are aware of their dismal service because the internet is saturated with people complaining about them and vowing not to buy from AMAZON because of this. (I am 1 of them).It really does your reputation no good to be associated with such a disreputable company.
amazon	Ash Radia-Osman	2017-12-20T14:08:24Z	5	Exceptional and outstanding products, delivery, customer service on par with John Lewis!!!
amazon	Claire Hillier	2017-12-20T12:07:28Z	4	Love amazon s quick postage time and items are well packed although I do worry about the environment and  hope the packaging is froma sustainable sorce as sometimes there a lot of it. Sometimes the item Description is lacking and unless you’ve researched your product it’s hard to know what deals the best as amazon can sometimes mix it up with similar products at different prices. Returns are easy and convenient and overall I would say it’s constant in its standard or selling. And customer care.
amazon	RT	2017-12-20T03:47:53Z	5	Customer service is great! Was able to log back in after someone hacked into my account. They had to verify every single purchase but as long as my account is back with all my history it was worth every minutes.
amazon	Emma	2017-12-19T18:43:54Z	5	What was life before Amazon! Just make sure you pick the right delivery option and read all the info ☺️🙌
amazon	Eleanor James	2017-12-19T17:12:49Z	1	I ordered a £230 PlayStation 4 as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and Amazon send me 4 dishwasher sponges for a value of 99p.Because I raised this issue with amazon and pointed out that they had in fact delivered ‘something’ Amazon refused to send me my actual order or offer me a refund to go and purchase the PlayStation somewhere else until they received the sponges back in the post.They sent me locations to return the sponges through Pass-my-parcel which I had to drive 30mins to get to to find out it doesn’t exist and they do not have the correct address for the location. When I looked on the internet, found another address myself I went to the location to find it has closed down.I have 3 1hr conversations with various people at Amazon and all the people contordicted each other, some offering refunds once the parcel was scanned in, one saying I cannot have a refund until an investigation has been undertaken - all of which were just a couple of days before Christmas when they had my £230 and wasn’t going to have any playstion or refund. It was the single worst experience of customer service I have ever recieved from a retailer and the worst communication and transparency. They were shameful!In the end I purchased the PlayStation from Currys who delivered it in 12hours and send numerous tracking texts and emails on the run up to delivery.I would never use Amazon for a high ticket item again because they don’t care at all about their customers but purely about keeping hold of your money.
amazon	michael nicoll	2017-12-19T17:00:43Z	5	Been using for a few years now.  Excellent at Christmas.  All has turned up on time.  Easy to order.  I have read the bad reviews on here.  Maybe I am just lucky, but I can't fault them on the orders I have made.
amazon	Dion	2017-12-19T16:22:02Z	1	I joined Prime and ordered 2 seperate products one took 7 days to arrive and the other 5 days not the next day delivery promised by Amazon.

amazon	Natalya Gayvoronskiy	2017-12-19T01:26:05Z	1	"Been ordering with Amazon for about last 5 years. Their customer service went down from 5 star to 0 since then. They can take up to 3 weeks to process your order if you are not paying $99 yearly fees. And then send it the slowest way possible.  I have talked to customer service and even the management. They act like it is all normal ""oh, I see you chose a free shipping, that's why"". Even though the free shipping is 5 to 9 business days.All they can do is bring their apologies, and not do nothing about it. I don't pay membership with Sears or Walmart, and get packages from them 4 times faster  ( free shipping)."

amazon	Jack	2017-12-18T15:40:03Z	5	Fantastic shopping experience.Amazon has gone above and beyond when it comes to my experience.I had 2 issues with 2 orders that were updated too late (5 days later) which meant that the presents that I got for my friends and their families across the US would be delivered at the end of Dec, or even beginning of January.I was disappointed, upset and generally annoyed at the service.Then I decided to contact their customer support to share my frustration.Long story short, all thanks to Rochel, the presents I got for my friends will be delivered BEFORE Christmas.I will continue using Amazon for as long as I live because they are disruptinging the industry when it comes to customer service.

amazon	Wendi Berry-Smith	2017-12-17T12:33:28Z	5	Love how easy it is to order, return and the fact they deliver when they say they will. Very reliable company, I joined amazon prime but realised I’d signed up twice, once in UK and the other in USA. Phoned up amazon and they sorted it out and refunded me very quickly. Well done Amazon. Not often companies are reliable with deliveries and have a good customer service these days

amazon	William Fritzen	2017-12-15T11:47:43Z	2	I ordered a package from Amazon delivered to Denmark. I did choose the regular delivery. This has caused in 3 weeks waiting time, and i do still not have my package in my hand. This is because of Amazon choosing the cheapest carrier, the company called Landmark which currently have a rating of 1.2/10 on trustpilot (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) i guess they have returned my package before even trying to deliver it. I think its shameful that a company like Amazon are not being a jour with their carriers.
amazon	Ashley	2017-12-15T09:09:29Z	5	Love the website!
amazon	Sherman Kelly	2017-12-14T22:23:02Z	2	Bought an item once. Payed for everything, later got an email from them saying the item is discontinued. Money was returned. Not such a big problem for me,But their shipping options are horrible. UPS and nuff said, you just sit and guess whether you receive your package or not. Yes, I am Amazon prime member. So better save your money for something else.
amazon	Chris An	2017-12-14T06:24:49Z	5	Honestly, I'm surprised Amazon isn't 5 stars here. Besides my only issue with a price match. (I bought an item and it dropped by $20, was promised a price match since it was from their site but didn't receive it)Everything else has been perfect and I ordered over 100 items!Customer service is great, shipping is fast!Pro Tip: Make sure you get items fulfilled by AMAZON for added protection!

amazon	Jamie Leoar	2017-12-07T20:30:18Z	1	They are so terrible during the holidays. Do not deal with them. They will double the prices and gouge your wallets. You will find just about everything 25% cheaper on eBay, Walmart, etc. GUARANTEED. If you are a seller, they will hold your money until the holidays are over because this is how they can fund their projects, with your money!  They will also steal all your suppliers if they benefit them.You will be sending plans after plans to their worthless seller support that will reply 2 weeks later.Good luck.
amazon	Duncan	2017-12-07T20:22:00Z	4	So far have had a great experience with amazon, have ordered quite a bit things from electronics to clothing, not a thing has gone wrong so far. Highly recomend getting your stuff threw amazon then any other website.
amazon	geo	2017-12-07T19:04:42Z	4	Never had an issue with this company, always deliver on time - usually early. I'd use them more if they didn't go out of their way to avoid taxes. But really there's no-one to touch them for value & service.
amazon	ABellToll	2017-12-07T17:53:09Z	5	I recently had two situations that could have been very bad that Amazon made a million times better.I place an order with no-rush shipping, set to be delivered 1 week before a Secret Santa event I was going to have. The package was delivered by USPS on a Sunday, so my normal mailman was not on route. They delivered it to the wrong address and I never got it, even after checking with USPS and all my neighbors.I contacted Amazon about this, and they had a replacement shipment out the same day with expedited 1-day shipping. One of my items had to be refunded instead of replaced because it was sold by a 3rd party seller, so I got an additional $10 voucher for any purchase and was able to place that order in time to get it for my Secret Santa event still!I just placed another order and my receipt said that the items were to be delivered on a Sunday. My heart sunk and I reached out to customer service again to ask them if they could have the order delivered on the next day, Monday. Instead, they chose to expedite the shipping to 1-day shipping!I can't believe how above and beyond they went for me! I know they do it so that I spread the word and tell my friends and family about how positive my experience as been, and I have to say, it works. I'm ecstatic and can't stop telling people how they absolutely fixed the situation 10x over.

amazon	tom tom	2017-12-07T05:17:42Z	5	Love Amazon. Can source easy and often far cheaper than elsewhere with free delivery in many cases.I love the Amazon fire stick so joined Amazon prime (get free movies/shows with Amazon media and also free 1 day delivery) - the delivery alone makes it worthwhile. Convenient to order with click of button with all details stored.
amazon	Jo	2017-12-06T22:28:11Z	1	Be aware that if you are unable to use the service that you pay for you will not get any kind of refund.  I belonged to Love Film but wasn't always able to watch two films a month - they just kept taking my money but now they have closed the service they are not making any refunds - so I have paid them for a service that I am unable to use because it's closed but I can't get my money back - really disgusted - I don't remember seeing this in the small print.
amazon	martin white	2017-12-06T20:11:29Z	4	Amazing company! Couldn't fault them in any way and if by chance they do get it wrong the go above and beyond to make up for their mistakes
amazon	Karl Dickenson	2017-12-06T15:57:18Z	4	I have ordered form amazon many times and never had a problem, service is exactly as described. The items are sometimes delivered before they are due or you get an email a day early then the item comes on the day expected anyway.. but overall very good.Cost wise, you can sometimes find items cheaper elsewhere but not often. The only downsides are that some of the items don't count towards the £20 free delivery and also once you place an order you can't add to it.
amazon	shane m	2017-12-06T09:59:34Z	5	Really great delivery options, I have used many times and the service has always been exceptional.  Always go to Amazon before other sites.
amazon	Jessica Desfier	2017-12-06T08:53:43Z	4	Ordered a product only and after 3 weeks, I still did not get it. Thanks to their customer service that pushed my patience limit to a little extra. And the issue was solved.
amazon	Kirill	2017-12-06T02:18:11Z	5	Been their Prime customer since 2015. No problem at all. Always quick shipping. If it's delayed one day I usually complain and they offer refund or other credit which works for me. CS is pretty good.
amazon	Liana Antonesi	2017-12-05T14:55:42Z	1	Worst company in the world! CS: non-existent, outsourced to barely speaking English, lying through their teeth, they just open case after case when you call, but lie to you every time, just keeping you wait. Amazon is a money-grabbing company soon to be discovered to be guilty of credit card fraud, bait and switch methods, with no respect for customers., just a money-thieving machine on the brink of collapse.
amazon	Stevie Lewis	2017-12-05T10:32:06Z	1	"I have been a customer of Amazon for years. Always had my orders on time and never had any problems. Although recently I have had to cancel multiple orders as their shipping carrier can not be bothered to ""find"" my flat and when I ring the customer services their response is that my item will be delivered the next day. Although I seem to have other people's delivered to my flat I can never seem to have my own. Really fed up with Amazon and their lack of effort!!"
amazon	Steven	2017-12-02T13:51:27Z	3	good experience with amazon but could be better in terms of price transparency. I got charged for the delivery.
amazon	Shawna Sartin	2017-12-02T10:44:35Z	4	I love Amazon and they have great customer service. I rarely have problems with my orders, and when I do, they usually take care of it pretty quickly. Amazon is awesomeness!
amazon	Sy Johnson	2017-12-02T06:50:31Z	5	Iv been using Amazon for a while now and I've always got what I ordered on time no difficulties no hassle. I love the Sales they always have. The $25 or more on purchase for free shipping is fantastic. Will not stop using Amazon and it will stay that way!
amazon	Jessica Mcnally	2017-12-02T06:46:18Z	5	I love shopping at Amazon and have had mostly good experiences. On the rare occasion that something isn't quite right, Amazon had always been great about fixing any issues.

amazon	104 sports	2017-12-01T08:36:06Z	5	Never had a problem with Amazon.  They deliver when they say they will and returns are smooth and easy...
amazon	john marks	2017-12-01T08:09:41Z	1	Impossible to get a refund when seller says delivered and lied . Orders that are late being dispatched and you try to cancel are ignored . Only contact seems to be a call from the Phillipines that they say they will do something and then do nothing. E-bay much more professional and safer to buy. Just found out they have been taking 7.99 a month out of my account for a service I never wanted!
amazon	Elisha Santaularia	2017-11-30T17:10:52Z	4	I've never had to call Amazon specifically for anything, however, if you do decide to order through Amazon, you NEED Amazon Prime. I didn't think it would be worth it, but it definitely is. Considering you get to watch movies and shows and get 2-day shipping, it's amazing. I give it 4 stars because there have been multiple instances where I will have items in my cart and I will get an e-mail the next day stating my item was ordered (this has happened like 3 times) so then I have to go through the hassle of sending it back.
amazon	Rooster	2017-11-30T16:31:41Z	1	very poor company and would not deal with them again

No matter what I'm in the market for whether it be vitamins or clothes or tools or food or anything, I always check Amazon first. They normally have the best prices and the quality is usually very good. It is so convenient to shop from home and avoid the crowds and the traffic and have your products delivered right to your front door. If you don't like something they have a great customer service and will accommodate you with the return and refund. Can't say enough good things about Amazon😍😍😍😍
amazon	Angelo Petrillo	2017-11-29T17:38:51Z	5	Great customer service, fast shipping, good prices. Love em. I actually order too much from them. LOL
amazon	Andrew Lee	2017-11-29T11:22:48Z	5	Biggest retailer on the planet so you would expect some issues but as both a seller on the platform and a buyer I really can't fault them overall. They are constantly improving and sometimes while progress can seem slow it is at least progress. This companies scale is staggering and for all that they do a really good job of juggling scale and customer care.

amazon	Laurie Starkey	2017-11-25T02:02:42Z	1	As a loyal and very FREQUENT customer, I am really saddened by my recent experiences with Amazon. I’ve had two recent orders that just didn’t arrive with very little explanation. And when I called, the associates I spoke to on both occasions were less than helpful, which ultimately led to my decision of canceling my prime membership. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with various Amazon representatives on Tuesday night trying to track down my package. After 2 hours of frustration I asked to just cancel all of my orders and cancel my prime membership. At the end of the 2 hours I was assured I would receive a refund for my order of $99.28 for my items that never arrived. After 3 days of not seeing my credit card credited, I called amazon for an update. The representative I spoke to told me my refund was never processed!!!! Why did I spend 2 extremely frustrating hours on the phone Tuesday night only to not have my issues and refund processed! I beyond frustrated with their service and mainly their delivery lately. I paid for my prime membership because I live in NYC and it’s just easier to order household items online as opposed to lugging heavy bags from the store. However when your items do not arrive in the “guaranteed prime” timeframe, it adds more stress to my life. Having to call and track down items and speaking to USPS time and time again makes the ease and appeal of online ordering less than appealing, and downright frustrating. I am saddened also because the amazon representatives I spoke to didn’t seem to care much about offering a solution other than “let’s see if the package arrives tomorrow”.  Unfortunately that is not a solution for me, also considering the hundreds and even thousands of dollars I’ve spent at Amazon. I understand that Amazon is a massive company and makes millions each year. I understand in the whole scheme of things, the few thousand dollars I spend with you doesn’t really matter, however I wanted to share my recent experiences with you, in the small chance it might matter.
amazon	Jan Cartwright	2017-11-24T11:26:49Z	3	I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, products are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with products directly from Amazon, I find their services lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.
amazon	Cesc	2017-11-24T06:48:35Z	1	Avoid if you can, and go shop somewhere else.I had similar experience with some other reviewers here, that their delivery team, Amazon logistics, claimed that they leave my package at a secure location, rather than being received by a person. The package was now either stolen or lost. Dealt with their customer service and they demanded a proof of non delivery which they refused to accept when I provided one. They are just making excuse to avoid a refund when they are the one who had been so negligent to leave a package unattended

Then I was placed on mute every few minutes until she finally came back and told me that she could not find the account but had me on hold and not telling me this.She finally passed me through to the EU offiice, she had the account found in less than 2 minutes and it IS a .com account!!I think this is appauling how it took longer than 10 minutes just to take an email address from Steph, and all the humming and ""errrr's"" I found very unprofessional. I advise NO ONE to deal with this call centre if they are all like Steph and I wouldn't even put it to a training issue, it was just the way this individual was which has wasted so much of my afternoon from something that should have been so simple!"
amazon	Muriel Wu	2017-11-23T07:37:13Z	5	I give this dress 5 stars because it was better than i expected it to be. simple but very elegant. Would recommend shipping took 2 days. I highly recommed that AbaoWedding store.

amazon	Jenn O'Brien	2017-11-22T14:49:20Z	1	Amazon uses their own delivery carrier for Prime members. Beware, because it’s tertible!! These people carelessly left a package outside my building on a very busy pedestrian street, posted a photo of it, sitting on the steps LITERALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET and then noted that I signed for the package upon delivery. Needless to say the package was stolen. Why would the carrier leave the package outside if they claim I signed for it?? Clearly it’s a lie to avoid reimbursement. I have now contacted Amazon multiple times with no resolution. Will be ordering elsewhere from now on!!!
amazon	Roberta	2017-11-22T12:56:31Z	4	Website works fine.It is a little unclear until the moment you want to purchase if seller is shipping to your country or not and of course additional shipping costs are added even with a little bigger order.
amazon	Kathryn Macallister	2017-11-22T12:36:42Z	1	Signed up recently to amazon prime. Ordered iPad cover delivery next day up to 8 o’clock at night checked track order throughout day imaging my surprise when checked again at 7.35 that they tried to deliver at 7 12 pm THEY DID NOT maybe because it,s near Christmas it was a chimney delivery alas I do not have a chimney. Phoned customer service receivedemail next day taking no responsibility and parcel will be delivered that day when parcel arrived it was open and confirmed my suspicion  (its an iPad cover it can wait to be delivered) so so angry I was lied to and the email they sent in response. I would have emailed amazon about this but it is very hard to find email address for amazon.DO NOT LIE TO YO CUSTOMERS
amazon	Andrew Collins	2017-11-21T17:34:29Z	1	Amazon are a terrible company. they employ yodel or dodgy eastern european drivers that say your parcel has been handed to the resident but we have not received any parcel. you try to speak to Amazon but they don’t understand. and they charge £7.99 per month for prime delivery. you get free music which is rubbish and free videos another waste. given up.

amazon	Miss GEMA  P.	2017-11-19T21:46:32Z	1	Amazon has lost my parcel. I bought a pair of trainers a week ago using prime. They were supposed to arrive on the next day. They tried to deliver them three days after I placed the order. I live in a new building so, on the delivery day the driver was having difficulty in finding it. I get a call from Amazon saying the driver cannot find my place, I offer to talk to him for directions but they say they can't put me through to him. However, I have talked to Amazon drivers for directions in two occasions before.No delivery that day or the next following 5 days. I called Amazon in two occasions and they said the parcel would be delivered on the day, didn't happen. Second time I call the customer service agent tells me they will give me a call once the driver has set off to my place. at 13:00 h. today I get a call from them saying they have lost my parcel and that they will refund the money. If I want my trainers I will have to buy them again.Horrible, horrible service.
amazon	Mango Boardgame	2017-11-19T04:45:37Z	1	I ordered books last month. Amazon shipped them from US to Thailand by only put the books in the plain box!No bubble wrap ,paper wrap or any material to protect the books.So the books came with severely damaged on every book when I recieved them.If you want to buy sth for your collection( in my case, books), DO NOT use amazon!
amazon	nayson rouhipour	2017-11-18T21:25:52Z	1	Amazon recently setup their own delivery service. Problem is they don't actually deliver the products you order, or have any ability to track said orders or give you any guidance when you call them. If this is the direction amazon is taking then i'd be very worried about their future since they can't get their affairs in order for simple things.
amazon	Nobody	2017-11-17T09:22:15Z	4	A nice buying site with great customer service, I love its service and I can always find something I like there!
amazon	Conner Fleming	2017-11-16T23:12:43Z	3	Mostly a good experience, but after I made an order with one-day delivery that was due to arrive today by 8pm ran late, I contacted customer service to see what could be done. I spoke to two different representatives, and both said the same thing, that I must wait for the order to be dispatched, then another date can be rescheduled, ignoring the fact that I needed the item on the guaranteed date of delivery. One of the selling points of Prime membership being one-day delivery, I find myself questioning whether to continue my membership as this isn’t my first experience like this.
amazon	Luke	2017-11-16T21:12:17Z	5	very good better customer service than most shops fast deliver easy returns and good prices

amazon	Michael	2017-11-13T01:41:08Z	1	"I ordered a watch from Amazon in early 2017 and never received it because the seller uses a dodgy delivery company. The delivery company has the one of the worst ratings a company has on the internet and uses students to deliver items. When I wrote a review of my experience Amazon refused to post the review because they believe I should only comment on the features of the product. I will never receive the product so how can I comment on it!How dodgy are Amazon! You effectively have your money stolen, never receive the product and they won't allow the review to appear on the website because I can only comment on the features. How can I comment on the features if I never received the product!!!! There must be hundreds of thousands of people out there like me who have had their money stolen in situations like this or had huge delays with receiving the product. Amazingly they didn't even offer to help me!!!! Beware, you will regret buying through Amazon!!!!The full review I wanted posted on the Amazon site is as follows:My watch was delivered when I wasn't home and the courier left a card. That part was ok, but everything after that point has been terrible. The card has no phone number to contact the company and it is asking me to submit a form online. When I follow the instructions on the card it is impossible for me to submit the online form to Fastway. I then waste my time searching for a phone number and call the company. No one is there to pick so I am asked to leave my number and someone will get back to me. A week passes and no one gets back to me. My friends birthday has now passed and I don't have a gift and I will be lucky to ever receive the watch. The delivery company is called Fastway and if you read the reviews it is probably the worst company in the world. The experience, even if I one day receive my watch, has been a nightmare from beginning to end. I would have been better off paying more elsewhere.Three months after I made the purchase my position was as follows:  It has been about three months since I ordered the watch and I am no closer to receiving it, with no help being offered by the seller or Amazon and no way of contacting the courier. I have checked the update of my purchase and it has been marked as ""delivered"". The option Amazon provide me on their website is to pay to purchase another watch!Three months and a few days after I made my purchase my position was as follows:  I found out the courier marked the watch as delivered two weeks before they even attempted delivery. That means the courier held the watch for two weeks for even bothering to attempt delivery.Also, because I put a negative review on this site about Fastway, they returned my watch back overseas to the seller. I emailed Amazon a few days ago asking for their help and received no reply.Be warned - don't ever use Amazon! Some situations might work out well, but when it goes wrong there is no one to help you. It is simply not worth the risk to go through months of worry. Amazon should be shut down.Five months after my purchase and my position was as follows:I ended up ordering a watch from ebay. It arrived in days and I was able to post a review about the experience and include details related to the shipping.I had to ask my bank for a charge back on my credit card because Amazon refused to help me obtain a refund even though the watch was returned to the seller. When my bank contacted Amazon to discuss the charge back request Amazon sent me an email asking why I wanted my money back when I already had my watch. I replied and then Amazon refused to communicate back to my bank so I had to wait 45 days before my bank could then take my money back from Amazon.It sounds like Amazon provided customer service years ago but now it is the most dodgy company you will ever encounter. You are better off trying to buy something from a market stall in Bangkok over the internet as opposed to going through Amazon. I honestly don't know how they remain in business. It must be that they just churn through people one at a time until people become turned off. One day they will run out of inexperienced people to screw over and the company will fall over."

amazon	Brenda L.	2017-11-11T03:18:09Z	5	The baby registry on Amazon is easy to use and comes with the incredible selection that only Amazon seems to offer.  I have received two gifts of my registry so far and my welcome box which had fantastic samples and a few free size items such as rattles and a swaddle blanket.  I chose to register at Amazon as it is convenient for all my friends and family and very pleased with my choice.
amazon	mikha posdim	2017-11-10T10:01:10Z	3	Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.

amazon	Kaushal	2017-11-09T18:24:02Z	1	"Both Customer Support & Seller are pathetic. Before making an order, I asked them if the item will be deliverable, to India(International delivery, USA to India), both customer support and seller said item will be delivered to India. But even then, before making an order, I tried to ask the same question from several customer support and they all said deliverable to India. Finally, I bought $2000 amazon gift card from third party. I made an order of laptop Dell Alienware 17 R4, I used gift card, and paid rest of the amount from my debit card. Following are the details.===================================================ORDER # 113-2215371-0609818ORDER PLACED October 7, 2017Alienware AW17R4-7006SLV-PUS 17"" Gaming Laptop (7th Generation Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, Silver) with NVIDIA GTX 1070Seller ==> Beach Camera Same Day Shipping ===================================================They cancelled my order, and when I asked customer support they asked me to make order again, as there must be some mistake. So I made the order again on 10th October. Following are the details.===============================================ORDER # 113-7252378-8515458ORDER PLACED October 10, 2017Alienware AW17R4-7006SLV-PUS 17"" Gaming Laptop (7th Generation Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD, Silver) with NVIDIA GTX 1070Seller ==> Beach Camera Same Day Shipping ===============================================They cancelled my order again. I again talked to customer support and seller both and really this made me crazy. They were giving wrong information, offering me $5-$20 for all of this trouble. Amazon Customer Support do not value their customer's time. Finally, I need to write mail to Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon and then I came to know, this item could not be delivered to India. and neither they can refund my Amazon gift card as it was bought by 3rd party, and neither 3rd party allows any refund. So my $2000 became waste now. I just sent my $2000 gift card code, to Jeff Bezos, as a contribution to improve the Amazon Pathetic Customer Support."

amazon	Rakesh Y	2017-11-03T07:37:02Z	1	I placed an order at amazon with my gift card balance which I had received from my cousin as a gift. It was a physical gift card purchased from a store. After waiting for 10 days, when order was not delivered, I contacted them and they asked me to send my id and address proof. Since then, I have faxed 3 times all the details, however, every time I receive the same message that I have to send the id and address proof. what a hell. If I send you something and you have not received it, you will ask me to resend it. If not clear to view, you will say so. BUT THE SAME CANNED REPLY.. MEANS THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO SHIP THE ORDER. BASICALLY THEY CHARGED 135 DOLLARS FROM ME WITH NO DELIVERY. THIS IS HOW THESE COMPANIES GET BIG PROFITS. THEY ARE BIG SCAMMERS.

When I have contacted them about removing 1 star reviews I have posted for some truely terrible products, they tried to pay me off with amazon credit instead of putting my reviews back.

amazon	Nie Ieie	2017-10-29T19:48:30Z	1	Amazon offered a special introductory promotion to Audible I applied to and did not complete their end of the offer. A $50 credit was supposed to be applied. They shot me around to different people and the same branches of the company multiple times. I tried to contact them multiple time after that and they did not update you or consider the customer at all. They completely absolve themselves of their responsibility and don't care about years of paid membership. I can't believe Amazon would do this. It's not just that they have turned into too much of a massive company and don't care about their customers anymore. They are Cheats.

When I contacted one of their agents, we discovered that Amazon gave me a ""refund"" by way of an Amazon gift card.  I did not request a gift card, I expected a true refund, to my bank card.  No one ever told me I would get a refund by way of a Amazon gift card.  And although their agent today told me today that now they have processed my refund, I went online to Amazon's site, and nothing new is reflected in my account.  I was told I would receive an email confirmation of the second processing of a refund, and hours later, no email."

I had one item that was pending for several months and despite calling customer service numerous times (they have horrible CR reps who are very condenscending and rude) I finally proved to them that the refund was received but not completed! I really was loving Amazon and was a net promoter..however this moment of truth has been very revealing about their lax customer service as well as user experience...I hope this can be a learning opportunity for Amazon and I can continue using....

amazon	Lars Northeved	2017-10-20T08:09:43Z	2	Why send mail on offers to a Danish Prime customer when what's offered is not shipped to Denmark?  I'm logged in so Amazon knows all the details.

amazon	Sebastian Miller	2017-10-18T19:42:46Z	5	Buying only Amazon shipped products led me to a very positive experience. Purchased a few times from the sellers directly on Amazon and had a couple of bad experiences but Amazon swiftly and professionally stepped in and all was refunded.The prices are on par and sometimes better of what I can find in stores and avoid the shopping out hassle.Their site could use some modern look but it doesn't deter my experience in any way.
amazon	Doug	2017-10-18T17:24:56Z	4	Great site with outstanding customer service and plenty of products from which to choose.Third-party sellers can also be a bit of a hassle to deal with from time to time. But if you're buying something directly from Amazon, their customer support will go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction.Occasionally, you'll also come across a product with some reviews that are obviously fake, but Amazon has done a pretty good job of cracking down on that sort of thing.
amazon	sylvia	2017-10-18T11:47:30Z	1	terrible, specially if you are using amazon seller account

Sometimes I had problem with items even 1 year after the purchase and they let me sent it back to them the next day and I got a full refund or the same new item with no added costs. I'll keep buying from them if they keep being so good

I wanted to query this so I requested a call back online and an unknown number called me. The advisor asked for the details and said that because it was from amazon.com and not amazon.co.uk she'd need to transfer me to amazon.com. The advisor at amazon.com was rude and blunt!! She asked for the amount in dollars. I explained that the payment was in £ pound sterling and she said she couldn't help me unless the amount was in US dollars. Again I explained that the payment was in £ sterling, because I live in ENGLAND!  She said I would need to speak to amazon.co.uk. After a few minutes of getting absolutely nowhere with this incompetent person, I asked to speak to a manager. She promptly put me on hold and then hung up on me. Absolutely disgusted by the phone manners and want to know how I am going to get my money back."
amazon	erik	2017-10-17T18:38:45Z	5	have been shopping at Amazon several times.They are 100% honest and if you order wrong item due to incorrect information about the product. they pay the return fee and you get ALL money back.I've got a product that turned out to be used. I gained about 20% of the priceI highly recommend Amazon, the right prices and usually delivered freely (if you buy for about $ 30, -).
amazon	Sudeep B	2017-10-17T14:26:02Z	5	one of the most trustworthy shopping websites, we rely a lot on amazon for global sales.
amazon	DS Chouhan	2017-10-17T10:54:27Z	5	A great e-commerce portal to buy whatever you want, including stuff that you cannot find in local shops. Easy purchases, including cash on delivery, and every other means of electronic payment. Tracking is fluid and delivery is always on time. The deliveryman also bring machines to help you pay with cards. Completely satisfied with the purchase.
amazon	Archie	2017-10-15T19:46:14Z	1	"Over a week to deliver a ""prime"" one day package, everyday an email saying courier couldn't deliver despite being in everyday and no one appearing. Hours and hours spent dealing with faceless, stock answers from Customer service every night. 7 days and still waiting, over a week late delivering. Every night told by customer service, delivery will definitely be the next day... they will ""personally make sure delivery will happen"". Guess what, no delivery. After 13 years and over 300 purchases I will never use them again. They couldn't care less about their customers. Disgusting."
amazon	Rose Strat	2017-10-15T00:08:20Z	5	I am a loyal amazon fan. When in doubt you can find on amazon and the 2 day free shipping has taken over my life. I don’t even buy toilet paper anymore
amazon	Vu Cu	2017-10-14T12:25:06Z	5	Instead of going to the supermarket, now I can get everything from home. The shipping is fast, only 2 days with Prime.

amazon	Ken Matthews	2017-10-13T13:36:56Z	5	fast delivery, great deals, what's not to like
amazon	Ben	2017-10-13T09:15:16Z	1	Bad stance on pre-orders from Amazon UK.The whole point of pre-ordering games is to guarantee that hardcore gamers like myself get games as soon as possible.I pre ordered WWE 2K18 Deluxe Edition around a month in advance to get the pre-order bonus and mainly to get it 4 days early. It has not arrived and is now in limbo with regards to when I get it.Amazon's response? The game is unavailable and out of stock due to high demand and it'll take us 2-3 business days to give you a response from another department.Out of stock is supposed to be impossible when pre-ordering since they guarantee receipt of the game on release day.I eventually received £10 off at Amazon which is useful but does nothing for the integrity of a pre-order guarantee. This is the third time Amazon have failed to get a WWE game to me as per the pre-order guarantee.
amazon	Alex Samuel	2017-10-12T15:47:28Z	5	Prompt delivery..post services also awesome..rarely E-commerce companies replace mobiles but Amazon is different from others. I really recommend Amazon.

amazon	Les	2017-10-11T18:50:42Z	4	They always treat me with respect, and try to take care of any problems that happen with the shipments. Once in awhile you get connected to a rude rep in chat though.
amazon	Dani Ya	2017-10-11T00:29:05Z	5	"Whether you're hanging on the coattails of someone else's Prime or using your own 30-day trial, Amazon is pretty awesome. I like that I can return things I impulsively bought and get refunded for it. Also, I love that I know what my friends are getting for me on my birthday and Christmas. Honestly, Amazon has also fed my addiction to books that I buy to look smart and not read (although I don't think it makes me look smart when all I buy are repeat volumes of Captain Underpants, but a copy of The Art of War balances it out I think). I'm currently waiting for a portable guitar. And before you say it, I know, all guitars are portable, but it's the one with like three frets and six-strings and you sort of just bring it around everywhere. Trust me, it's kind of cool. A lot of the things I've gotten from Amazon have been good. No complaints really. ALTHOUGH, the recent purchases I have (baring the portable guitar) been sad face qualities, so I returned it. And guess what? It was so easy! In any case, I think I have used Amazon to encourage my ""don't talk to people and stay in the darkness of your room"" ways. To be honest, I'm on my way to becoming a hermit and Amazon makes it possible. Thank you, Amazon! Cheers!"
amazon	Toni	2017-10-10T22:22:59Z	5	they the best what can i say, having prime has made my shopping and shipping process a piece of cake :)
amazon	Violi Saverio Pietro	2017-10-10T14:44:00Z	5	Acquisto da amazon da ormai anni. Mai una pecca, un unico pacco ricevuto rotto all'interno, subito cambiato. Infallibile.Purchased by amazon for years. Never a foul, a single pack received broken inside, immediately changed. Infallible.

amazon	Illiandra	2017-10-06T23:28:18Z	5	I use Amazon with Prime all the time and I just love it! Not only is the three day shipping great, the video selection is a bonus too. Love it!
amazon	Gerald	2017-10-06T08:09:57Z	4	I LOVE AMAZON!   I stole a star from them because I hate to type and I would love to have at least, voice search.    Especially when you are old and arthritic like me or very relaxed or under the influence and very susceptible  to over buying and getting things you dream about  instead of the things you need. Just sayin'.
amazon	Mariela Nunez	2017-10-05T16:16:05Z	5	I go to regular stores for regular day items but I always end up comparing prices with Amazon and Guess What? They never dissapoint! I recently save $10+ by getting it on Amazon instead of in the retail store.
amazon	Nora Terstyanszky	2017-10-04T15:15:20Z	5	Amazon is brilliant in every aspect. You can find pretty much anything on their site and they deliver earlier than stated usually. Aftercare is easy and always good. I can highly recommend it.
amazon	Heather Hyslop	2017-10-04T10:04:35Z	5	If you can't find something AMAZON is the place for you. I buy from Amazon on average once a week and have never been disappointed or let down.
amazon	Jamie Smith	2017-10-03T22:04:22Z	5	Amazing anazon
amazon	Amber Colson	2017-10-03T15:27:29Z	5	I just want to commend Amazon's customer service. I've had a problem with my purchases -- my fault, not theirs -- and I got in touch with them through email and they were able to resolve the issue in less than half an hour. I mean, that's a 5-star company right there! Super impressed!
amazon	Aaron	2017-10-02T18:47:48Z	5	Seamless, effective, cheap. Great
amazon	Heather Smith	2017-10-02T15:09:32Z	5	Great customer service and return policy--you get all your money back and free shipping on returns. Love Amazon.
amazon	To Thanh An	2017-10-01T08:58:40Z	2	"I used to love shopping in Amazon due to superb services and quality goods but the experience I have had with Amazon is really frustrating. For the last three orders, all the orders was notified as ""shipped"" and then ""lost in transit"" and then I have had to contacted Amazon many times to solve the problems which have not been solved yet. Some items have not been delivered to me even though the order was placed in the mid of August. The worst part is that one of items is a gift (then they offered me free Expedited Delivery but I am just not sure whether they can be delivered on time).   I do not what is going on with the Amazon. I assume that the rapid growth and expansion, the quality assurance is not met."
amazon	Nicole Beverly	2017-09-30T15:47:26Z	5	I love Amazon! Anytime I've had an issue they've fixed it immediately!!!
amazon	Bilal	2017-09-30T04:48:13Z	4	Excellent overall except their prices are not the cheapest always, a lot of times you could get much better deal at walmart or jet or ebay or even target or dollar store so make sure not to blindly suscribe to items without comparing prices. Retail king but walmart is catching up with free 2 day shipping and discounts for pickup as well.
amazon	Mandy	2017-09-29T16:55:55Z	1	"I am writing this review regarding amazon deliveries and not amazons products which I do love.I ordered some cat food yesterday (thursday) which had free standard shipping. However, as it's the only cat food my cat can eat I needed it quickly so opted to pay £4.99 so that I could get it for her today.Just received the dreaded email which states-'We tried but failed to deliver your package today. We’ll try again tomorrow. For business addresses, deliveries will be attempted Monday to Friday only.""This is absolute rubbish from amazon logistics as I have been in all day waiting and looking out for it and yet again there is no card left. So I paid £4.99 for nothing and could have had the standard shipping. I am fuming and have emailed amazon asking for my next day delivery costs to be returned. We shall see what they say but I am sick of companies like amazon logistics, yodel etc claiming they attempted delivery when they clearly haven't."
amazon	Samantha	2017-09-29T16:44:25Z	5	It's so gorgeous, so delicate, I love it. Thank you!
amazon	Nan Z	2017-09-29T15:05:16Z	2	Amazon has slipped over the past year.  They sell their Prime membership but are struggling to get orders out in promised time.  I wonder if they have bit off more then they can chew.  They can't handle the volume of business.
amazon	Tom Mitchell	2017-09-29T13:23:16Z	1	worst company to buy from as they use 3rd party sellers and yodel to deliver.i have had a seller be rude to me when i asked a question and amazon promised to bar him from their site but he,s still selling on there.they wont let you write a bad review to warn other people about bad sellers so they keep getting away with it.best to not order from a comapny that is a front to 3rd party sellers who are not vetted just another ebay clone.stay away from both
amazon	bouraib toufik	2017-09-29T11:21:47Z	4	I checked Amazon site was awesome
amazon	Jack77	2017-09-29T07:43:05Z	5	Good fast delivery with perfect packaging !
amazon	Daniel Todd	2017-09-28T09:42:03Z	3	As a website it is good. But if you're a sellers you will have a lot, I mean A LOT of problems, and you will surely need to consider that with a support (that answers only via email per 1 business day+ not on all questions you have. So you will repeat'n'repeat it forever, until you already will post something.) Very hard to understand how the whole tables , codes, etc work, because you can find it on some japan forums, but not on the official site.
amazon	immanuel esc	2017-09-28T03:55:35Z	2	Poor . bad . Not a very good website for buying world wide The taxes are very high and the shipping price gets more than 150 dollars i wont buy or sell from that website again
amazon	Tess Evans	2017-09-28T00:55:55Z	1	My review relates to author's whose books are listed on there.  I would not buy anything from them at this stage, even if they paid me to do so.  When the company receive a DMCA, staff member 'Chad' will claim that he's unable to read, despite working in a legal department.  He will insist that you re-send the DMCA several times before it is accepted.  It is often better to leave Amazon as a last resort, email all other contacts first, because they normally resolve the issue while Amazon are still claiming that they can't find your address, or some other detail, on the DMCA in front of them.  Unfortunately, you will probably have to deal with Amazon, because they host a large number of the illegal download sites.  As regards illegal book download sites, you will notice that any inaccuracies stated on Amazon are copied onto the illegal download sites. As regards inaccuracies stated on Amazon; edits to one Amazon site will not carry over onto the other sites, you have to edit each individually.  They will not delete your books, even if they are out of print, or were never available for sale.  They allow book sellers to make any changes they wish, but deny that right to the copyright owner.  This is because they derive a monthly income from book sellers and they want you to pay that fee as well, so although there is an 'author central' for UK, France, Germany, Japan and America, they will often ignore your edits, complete them incorrectly, or claim that you wish to edit something they are not able to edit.  I would note that not all the Amazon sites are completely incompetent and I will do separate reviews for those, having now dealt with all of them.    The American site are rude and unwilling, they take an absolute age to make the simplest of edits and willfully admit that they have people registered as the 'copyright owner', or 'publisher' of work not owned by the registrant - when asked to elaborate or provide details, they will refuse to do so, thereby willingly and knowingly supporting copyright and royalty theft.  'Mike Hammer' of Amazon (US) will eventually send you a supervisory email, after you've received multiple emails from the 'team' about unrelated issues, suggesting that they do not understand your edit, or their job.  His email will inform you that the correct way to edit Amazon US is to fill out the 'Report a Problem' form on each page, as members of the public do and then he will inform you that you could join 'seller central' (paid service), where you will be able to edit whatever you want - thereby giving an author less rights to their own work than; publishers, thieves, the public, book sellers and of course; Amazon.  He will then abruptly inform you that 'this is Amazon's final response to this issue', like the sociopathic, pumped up incompetent he is and as such displaying his unfounded arrogance, as such people love to do, because it gives them a temporary feeling of unachieved superiority, which is much quicker than working for that stuff. Not only that, apparently Amazon pay minimal wage and low taxes, so there is little wonder that they are a billion dollar company, but only when there is no more art and no service amenities and all workers are living off food stamps will society realize that Amazon may be cheap, but its' company practice is not what the world needs and by then it will be too late, so for your own purposes;Only send them a DMCA when you have exhausted all other options.  Unless it is of huge importance, don't even bother contacting the American site regarding edits to their listings, if their incompetence doesn't get you, their attitude problem will.If your book has been listed incorrectly, you would be best advised to edit it on other sites, so that your other listings are correct.  Other book selling sites are only too happy to hear from an author and make appropriate edits, because good listings sell books and that is their business.  Don't waste too much time on Amazon and don't pay them any money, unless you really have to/want to.I would further note, unlike other companies listed on this site, there is no option to send your review to the company you are praising/complaining about.  Now, officially that will be because they are 'too busy', but given their standard of service, that is obviously incorrect.  The actual reason is that they have no interest whatsoever in what any of you think; good or bad.  They just want your money.
amazon	Max	2017-09-27T14:02:19Z	5	nice fast delivery
amazon	josh	2017-09-26T22:11:10Z	3	amazon is great but what get me mad is that IF YOU AIN'T IN THERE PROGRAM . you can't write no reviews or they band you from writing reviews. I am honest person and I show video/pictures of the products and still got band.
amazon	Roshan Khamankar	2017-09-24T06:52:01Z	2	It's a worst customers service. I am order sandisk pendrive on 19 September and the delivered me transcend pendrive after that i am register complaint that time i found that my Amazon generated order id and invoice order id is different and they didn't give me my product replace. But the way those guy's talking is like irresponsible. Icall there 5-6 times every time the told me different and the hight time is that senior cut my phone from there side without solving my issue
amazon	Laura	2017-09-23T18:53:01Z	5	I absolutely recommend them. the quality of the products and the shipping of them.
amazon	Nancy Powell	2017-09-23T05:04:01Z	5	I use Amazon very often and I really enjoy it. I enjoy their fast shipping and have also used the site to find smaller shops that I have never heard about before. I will alwasy recommend Amazon.com
amazon	Peter	2017-09-22T15:06:52Z	5	I didn't like control faceplate in my personal account, It's not friendly at all. Please, be mindful of my review and make faceplate more understandable and shorty
amazon	Jessmine	2017-09-22T07:57:12Z	5	Very fast delivery, great products. I live in Slovenia, near to Italian border, so I get my orders really fast (on italian address). I suggest to pay for Prime, it's worth it!
amazon	Andy S	2017-09-20T21:46:58Z	3	I've made many orders with Amazon.com over the years and have generally been very pleased, except for my last order which was a complete disaster which never made it to me and is presumed stolen by an Amazon or UPS employee. The item is tracked however never made it in to UPS's hands. I waited three weeks then started contacting Amazon for help, each time being passed on to an Indian call center, and each time they were generally rude and unhelpful and refused me a refund and outright lied to me, was not until I demanded to be put through to an American did the problem finally get resolved, a month and  a half after the product went missing. Has put me off ordering from them ever again. 'World's best customer service' my foot..
amazon	Shweta Parekh	2017-09-20T17:15:29Z	1	Ordered a wireless Bluetooth speaker. Delivery was made after 15 days. Though they promised to deliver within a week. Moreover the product was defective. Even after repeatative complaints, there is no response from the customer care. Absolutely disappointed by the service
amazon	Garrett	2017-09-20T16:41:13Z	5	Easy to see why it is a growing company.  I have ordered over 100 times here and only 1 mistake which was fixed.  This company is ran on great guidelines.
amazon	Sophie	2017-09-19T21:25:24Z	5	Love them. Rarely shop anywhere else.

amazon	Andrew Dinh	2017-09-15T16:39:03Z	5	Great Service, great selections, great customer support & timely delivery. Would buy from them again and again.
amazon	Tommy DeArgento	2017-09-15T13:37:51Z	4	love using amazon. we got rid of prime but still order all the time. decent.
amazon	Andy Andrew	2017-09-15T10:28:14Z	5	Great service, great price and the best part of the company is their delivery promises :)
amazon	Lindsey D	2017-09-13T19:08:02Z	4	Amazon service is consistently positive. A few teething problems with prime but overall a good service. Good to see a company take responsibility when a product is fulfilled by them and something goes wrong (like a smashed, leaking glass jar).
amazon	Susan Bourquin	2017-09-13T17:19:51Z	5	I've been very happy with Subscribe and Save.
amazon	Luca	2017-09-13T14:02:30Z	5	Although amazon is a place to find everything right now, I mostly use it in an old-fashioned way - to buy books. The selection of items is bigger than anywhere and personalized offers is what makes me keep coming back. No need to spend time on researching the web to find the next book you should read, this website knows exactly what I’m interested in. That’s awesome!
amazon	Tammi Lorraine Gubert	2017-09-12T14:19:50Z	2	I ordered a mouse on a Saturday via Prime. I received notification the item was shipped on Sunday. Delivery was attempting on Monday, according to text message and my account. I called  on Tuesday morning to figure out why delivered failed, and was given no explanation. I was told delivery would be attempted again Wednesday, which is 3 days after it shipped. It was a gift for someone, and this is not even the first time this has occured. Service with Amazon Prime has become unreliable and unacceptable!!
amazon	Harrison Tao	2017-09-12T04:39:59Z	3	Amazon manipulates IT'S OWN PRODUCTS reviews!!! But otherwise nice and convenient.
amazon	Mark Ellis	2017-09-12T00:49:35Z	5	I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and have bought thousands of $$ of stuff from them. Every single experience has been absolutely top notch.The order process and status of your order is the best in the industry.On the rare occasion that something is wrong you can always get in touch with them in just a few minutes. I also love the fact that will ship the replacement right away while you are doing the return.This is the best online retailer out here. Keep up the great work Amazon...

amazon	410Casper2017	2017-09-09T22:50:21Z	5	I place orders all the time on Amazon for work and for personal use.  The orders ship quickly, arrive in good condition, in a timely fashion and are exactly what I ordered/ expected.  Their website is one of the most user friendly ones I use daily, so I order from Amazon as often as I can.
amazon	Jamie Purkis	2017-09-08T21:08:21Z	4	Consistently excellent service, speedy delivery, and good prices and range of products.
amazon	Allie	2017-09-08T05:19:17Z	5	I love amazon, I have prime and I just don't think I could live without it. I got screwed by a couple websites trying to get a dress for a wedding and they got me the dress and everything I needed to go with it so quickly (and school books too) just wanted to say it on here to counteract the bad reviews I left for those other sites!
amazon	Chris Baker	2017-09-07T13:56:02Z	5	I have used Amazon many times to buy secondhand mobile phones, it really is a great place to pick up some great bargains.I cant really complain too much, even though I have had the odd phone not last long, they tend to be okay. I will continue to keep my eye on Amazon to find good deals, its not the only site to buy but its still good.
amazon	Doug Crawford	2017-09-07T08:37:12Z	1	I bought a Jawbone activity tracker through Amazon as it is a great site and I buy a lot of stuff on it. However, when the product failed the manufacturer failed to honour the warranty because the product wasn't in fact sold by Amazon but by a third party supplier through Amazon. I had assumed buying from Amazon would have given me some protection but it doesn't so be very careful, suppliers might not honour warranties if you buy through Amazon.
amazon	Robert Abnous	2017-09-06T19:29:09Z	5	Amazon has become my Goto place for all purchases now. Just make sure you look around for Prices and Reviews before you purchase.
amazon	Wong	2017-09-06T06:03:30Z	5	I love it. Their prices aren't always the best but their product service is great. Just buy from top sellers and you will not have any problem. in my Experience. Great selection and prices and they really care that you are satisfied with your transaction.

amazon	Amar Akshat	2017-09-02T01:27:58Z	2	"I have done a lot of business with Amazon Japan and they are trustworthy when it comes to evaluating them. Unfortunately Amazon US is not trustworthy. I ordered a TV, and they put me into Scheduled delivery section due to the size of the TV. I ordered on a Sunday, and followed up on Monday--Thursday via chat and phone call.  Everytime they said, different things, -- It will ship within a couple of days. -- I will ship next week. -- I will escalate and find out. Finally on Thursday one agent told me: ""Oh I am sorry, I dont think we have an inventory for this, we will have to refund""So I lost a gift opportunity here. In order to ""please"" me, they then offered a discount as refund on the 2ns TV I bought. When I get the refund receipt it said: Reason for refund: Damaged during transit. This was plain wrong, the TV didn't even reach the destination and the refund was for them being wrong in lying to me. I followed up and got that corrected. So their agents were all pretending to help me earlier with a bunch of mis-information, and later they were trying to hide that under the hood by calling it a shipping problem."
amazon	Marie Patel	2017-09-01T23:15:11Z	5	I used amazon in my small business I love all their big discount and coupon.. More Power!!!
amazon	Beth A	2017-09-01T17:18:11Z	4	Amazon has changed over the years.  Their prices aren't always the best but their customer service is great, in my experience.  I make several purchases every month but I do shop around to make sure I'm getting the best deal and I pay special attention to who the seller is.  I'm a Prime member so I get things relatively quickly.  Recently, I received an envelope that was empty.  I realized there was a small hole in the corner where I believe the item fell out (or was taken out).  I really feel bad when things like this happen but I can't be paying $20 for an empty envelope.  There were very apologetic.  It was a Prime day special but they refunded me and said they would credit me back on the discount, which I greatly appreciated.

amazon	Patricia L DeGeorgio Deleon	2017-08-31T13:33:15Z	3	AMAZON is FOR BUYERS not SELLERS! they rip you off and charge you an arm and leg for selling stuff. I literally sold over $800 dollars worth of books and ended up with $350 due to the fees and I had the seller option which was 80 bucks a month if you have tons of listings. I thought it would help me, but either way they get you. Plus their are so many TROLLS that buy your new books and return the same book but used! They get away with it too! I had that happen, had proof of the fraud, and they still took the money out of my account! I am done selling with them. I would rather sell elsewhere!
amazon	Emma Roberts	2017-08-31T12:52:06Z	1	So willing to contact me, so unwilling to let me contact them. No communication.
amazon	Sun Yen	2017-08-31T11:06:14Z	5	Superb customer service, great prices and vast choices. Always satisfied
amazon	Bella	2017-08-30T20:55:18Z	5	Quick and easy. Customer service is touch and go. Delivery time is usually great if your a prime member.
amazon	luux veriitas	2017-08-30T16:46:49Z	4	"Here`s a slightly bigger review: relax with some nice whale sounds, and get some coffee.No company is going to be perfect and to say the least, it hasn`t always been sunshine and rainbows ordering from ""the king e-commerce"". For me, it`s definitely acceptable and I haven`t really got any huge complaints. Now, here`s the primary little irks - the only real problems I have had with the company, and to be fair it`s more with the delivery than anything else:I might say that 90% of orders are fine but it`s not been totally uncommon to receive a heavily damp package - damp not exactly because of rain but because of what I imagine is just a highly humid method of storage. My preference is for books and tech-related items so whilst normally I can not complain much about this issue, I`m not fully convinced that my orders will arrive in good condition, as of course, these items are particularly sensitive to damage when damp. Now, the professionalism of a tiny few of the courier services leave a lot to desire. Let`s say that one in twenty of my packages - most concerningly common: laptops - are delivered to the wrong house, in spite of correct address written down at the order time. There were no knocks, zero notes through my letterbox or really any indication of where it has gone. I have to run around the neighbourhood knocking on everyone`s doors like I`m playing Trick-or-Treat. If they (the courier) do bother to knock, packages are often quite heavily bashed around and can be dirty. I don`t exactly expect the delivery driver to rub my feet and call me pookie but carelessness just creates more problems for everyone involved.I don`t wanna call out names for the particular courier service I solely seem to have issues with, after all, they are mostly acceptable, so I`ve written it down in the form of a fun anagram for all the family: REYESHMMAs long as they are not actually broken, I do not mind this, but it`s the carelessness and chance of damage that doesn`t fill me with hope. It`s worth mentioning that I don`t think I have ever had a package that is late, so thumbs up for that. So, for those thinking of ordering expensive items: be careful and make sure to research.For less-expensive items (aside from books), I honestly haven`t had any issues, really.I`ve also heard of numerous people being charged for Amazon Prime after valid cancellation - even years after. So: if you have a particularly low balance on your credit card at any moment, watch out for this."

amazon	Pankaj Kumar Rana	2017-08-24T17:33:16Z	5	I am the frequent buyer of Amazon.com and trust Amazon more than other online shopping websites due to its really satisfied customer support and faster delivery experience.
amazon	Danny	2017-08-24T13:06:35Z	5	Never really had a bad experience with Amazon, I order everything from them and Prime is a fantastic value for money. Customer service has been spot on since the start and they do everything possible to help out. Not a single quibble to pick at for Amazon, love them.
amazon	Gowthame	2017-08-24T09:01:14Z	5	Every day shopping on amazon enjoying it
amazon	Anthony	2017-08-23T12:43:57Z	1	I like Amazon. I buy everything I need from them, I'm a member of Prime and Fresh, so why have I given them Just one star?Because they used to collect any returns but now they do not, and using the internet to try and get to speak to a human is simply impossible owing to everything you press or anything you press takes you back to where you were, which is bloody frustrating. It's fine if you are able bodied and can pop into the car and take returns to a store somewhere, but what about invalids? We can't got to the places, and hopping into a cab there and back would probably cost more than the item you're returning.Amazon is victimising the disabled, which in the UK I believe is against the law. I didn't become an invalid on purpose, just to upset Amazon, I became disabled in the army while on active service ... Well done Amazon.
amazon	Jasmine Hewitt	2017-08-22T15:47:15Z	5	Always beats in store prices and best customer service. I never have a problem with Amazon!
amazon	Alicia Waterman	2017-08-22T12:39:10Z	4	Amazon has covered it all! Amazing customer service.

For what I pay if I can not enter in the account,  for addition I Don not want send my information to the AMAZON, I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND CLOSE THIS ACCOUNT.
amazon	Matt H	2017-08-18T14:56:54Z	5	Great service and they look after their loyal customers.Every time I have had an issue it has been resolved quickly and fairly.
amazon	Aytug Seyrek	2017-08-18T13:05:40Z	5	Excellent customer care, they help you with everything. I've been using it for years and never had a problem. Best shopping website ever.
amazon	Shiela Marie Anunciacion	2017-08-18T07:44:54Z	4	I've started using Amazon Prime around 2 months ago. I used the free trial, actually forgot about it and saw that I was being charged $9+/mo. by Amazon. So, I tried my benefits as a Prime member. As of now after 3 orders, I'm quite happy with having free 2-day shipping and discounts. As well as free books, movies and music. I usually buy digital cards for games. But now that I found out I could probably get discounts for all Prime eligible items and sometimes even a free next day delivery (which they have yet to not fulfill). I'm quite satisfied. I must say this is actually a 4.5 star review. And will continue so, until they do something to irritate or frustrate me.
amazon	Teresa	2017-08-18T03:59:12Z	1	no more here its not worthy!!.....
amazon	CaptainMagical	2017-08-18T01:07:10Z	4	It is what is seems. Most reliable website for buying stuff on. Actually, over half the stuff in my room was bought from amazon. I've never gotten a broken item shipped. Amazon Prime is so useful, especially now that it lets you sub to a streamer on twitch.tv for free once a month. Only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is for the return and online support. But, I've never had anything break so... not really a problem.
amazon	Rebecca F	2017-08-17T20:29:57Z	5	Consistently exceeds expectations! I order almost everything from Amazon now.. can't recommend highly enough.
amazon	Saif	2017-08-17T16:25:15Z	3	Amazon is a great company with alot small problems, specially when it comes to vaguely answered customer service questions and those people have very limited power to help you with.And my most hated thing is the order status there should be more information and it should be more accurate.Other than that am happy with Amazon.
amazon	Miriam Sofie	2017-08-17T16:25:06Z	2	Seems like they don't have much quality check of who they cooperate with. Sometimes my package didn't arrive and no one answered my emails, sometimes the package was so poorly packed that it was ruined and sometimes the quality was so bad I could not wear it.
amazon	Shaun Robertson	2017-08-17T11:57:54Z	5	Always had fantastic service from Amazon.  Prime has always been useful for me and the price is very reasonable considering everything you get.Top company!
amazon	Cyrus Razavi	2017-08-17T11:51:28Z	1	As a buyer I have great experience with Amazon, but trying to become a seller on the site is a nightmare. I have tried to open a seller account as a business and private person, with the same result, a very bad experience.The first time a sales agent from Amazon contacted me and convinced me that my company should be present on Amazon. After some pressure from her side I accepted reluctantly. I filled out the sign up form and uploaded ALL the required documents. The amazon came back and asked for documents which where not required initially.  i sent them and they came back for more. The worst part is they actually charged my account for subscription before even validating and activating the account. I had to complain and have the account closed.A couple of year later I tried to open a private seller account, Once again I filled out the signup form, uploaded all the required documents. 1 month later and still nothing had happened. I contacted customer service by chat, and I was told the case would be escalated. 14 days later still nothing. I decided to use their online form to contact Amazon. A couple of days later I received an email, where they requested more information,  however the information requested was already supplied in my answers at signup when I filled out the form. Why waste my time by asking the same questions twice, specially after having me wait for over a month. Once again I notice my account was charged for a subscription fee, but how can this be possible, if my subscription is not active, the account not approved yet and I cannot sell on Amazon. Once again I had to contact customer service, I got a refund and I asked them close the account.It is easier to get a loan in the bank than it is to open a seller account on Amazon. If they are not interested in new sellers just suspend new signups, instead of wasting peoples time.
amazon	Mike	2017-08-16T19:41:31Z	5	Such an incredible buying experience. Fantastic UI on the website and customer service and shipping time is unreal.
amazon	Aly	2017-08-16T18:39:08Z	5	I've always had great experiences with Amazon. Their customer service is fantastic. There have been a few instances where I never received my package, and they resolved the situation promptly. Their delivery is fast and convenient. I also appreciate the student discounts they provide for Prime membership.
amazon	tara	2017-08-14T21:08:04Z	2	I have generally quite enjoyed buying kindle & audio books on the website. So it was much to my annoyance when I discovered that the moment I logged in the price of certain books rose.
amazon	Tina Jones	2017-08-14T19:10:47Z	5	I love Amazon. its so easy. i order probabaly too much. Prime is perfect
amazon	Loane Sharp	2017-08-14T12:43:20Z	4	There's no doubt: Amazon is amazing. The range, the reviews, the prices, the service, the convenience. But as someone living outside the U.S., I need more global shipping options. Perhaps 2/3 or 3/4 products do not ship internationally at all, at any price. If Amazon wants to provide the best service in the universe, I say come down to earth first. Let's get the global shipping options expanded then we'll talk about that colony on Mars.
amazon	Lester	2017-08-13T23:28:20Z	5	Best for phone cases etc. Don't use Mobilefun.ca, its a waste of time
amazon	alex	2017-08-13T16:43:51Z	5	great got my items really quickly
amazon	K Lawrence	2017-08-13T01:24:28Z	3	"I used to love Amazon and it used it almost daily to purchase items. I am a prime member but I find most prime items are more expensive. I dislike the ""add on"" only set up of items. I don't like the fact I have to pay separate subscriptions for each Alexa/echo  I have in my home. My deliveries always turn up on time and on the rare occasion I have had to return something it has always gone incredibly smoothly although I have read they will ban customers who return too many items which is slightly off putting. I like Amazon but just don't use it as much anymore as it is no longer competitive with its prices and I don't like feeling ""had"" with hidden fees. I won't be renewing my prime membership."
amazon	Amanda Fernando	2017-08-11T16:14:32Z	5	Fantastic customer service - resolved my issue promptly and without fuss. Such a pleasant surprise for such a large company. Thank you Amazon!
amazon	Janardhan Bhoir	2017-08-11T06:15:16Z	1	Bad Service for consumer not solution for consumer problem. Very Bad
amazon	Greg A	2017-08-10T22:49:15Z	4	They have pretty much everything.  Pricing is fair and cheaper than other places in most cases.  If you don't have Amazon prime, shopping can still be free with a minimum spending.  Shipping time varies on the item you ordered and where you're located.  Regular people also sell items on Amazon so pricing and quality varies.  Lots of items have divergent buying options due to different sellers.  I usually just but from Amazon and not other users, unless that's the only option.
amazon	PAGE	2017-08-10T13:15:38Z	5	Great experience

amazon	Maria	2017-08-09T18:35:09Z	5	Not only do I get free shipping with my membership but it's fast delivery. Also, with my membership I get Amazon video & Amazon music. What else could I want. They should start selling vacations 👍

amazon	MKurtz	2017-08-08T22:18:29Z	5	THE BEST IN THE WORLDThere is no other who can compare with Amazon on every single level. No one else can compare.I use Amazon for EVERYTHING, from kitty litter to televisions sets and they never disappoint. Whatever issue might arise is immediately resolved in a way that shows how much they care about YOU. Hands down, they are number one.

amazon	Mark Pamintuan	2017-08-08T13:42:30Z	5	Well, what could you argue about Amazon? It has everything (if not the most) you could ever think of buying! I have already bought couple of items in Amazon and they are all good. Fast shipping is dependent if you have Prime and depends on your location. I commend their support team as they are very friendly and professional.Two thumbs up!

amazon	Kellbell	2017-08-07T17:14:05Z	5	"Amazon.is my most favorite place to shop ever, they always meet or beat the cheapest price for an item,I know I order everyday. I.know there's been some controversy over reviews but I want to set the record straight. There are many people that provide legitimate, honest reviews on products, they aren't paid, swayed or compensated in any way. I don't know how it came to be if you review a lot of stuff, your writing ""fake"" reviews. I buy almost everything from Amazon so I write tons of reviews and I can honestly say I've never written a untruthful review in my life, ever. I can't say that everyone in the world writes honest reviews but what I can say is don't disregard a review if the person reviews a lot of items. I enjoy sharing my thoughts on products because I always read reviews, I hope in paying it forward.Amazon also has exceptional customer service, it didn't start out this way they had terrible, hard to understand reps who didn't provide a solution to your issue and didn't care. This is all changed, they respond quickly, efficiently and provide an immediate solution, it's truly one of the best companies in terms of service out there.I wish they would stay away from buying grocery stores and expanding, people don't realize if you automate everything, YOU WILL CRUSH THE ECONOMY! You can't take away cashier, stocking, manager and every other job that regular grocery stores need without having major consequences. PLEASE stop, you have a great footprint already and have put tons of companies out of business but this grocery store business will have devastating effects. Stay with the online website and I'll continue to give you my business."

Discription size did not match on delivery posted message to seller no response left it a while WILL NOW CONTACT AMAZON SOON AS I GET CHANCE. I have left me with a sour experience as when orders are from Amazon directly there are no issues but 3rd party not so much will still shop with Amazon with a view to avoid 3rd party if possible.

Basically as a business we wanted to sell on Amazon. They have all my personal data, bank account, credit card details, bank statements, companies house information BUT I cant sell on the site and nobody can figure out why not! worse than useless. Now I have no idea where my personal data is stored and how it will be destroyed! 1 Dept after another and still no further forward. Poor poor poor!

amazon	KEVIN	2017-08-01T17:55:30Z	1	Unless you join prime, shipping takes forever.  I have been using Amazon since 2001.  Used to be fast, dependable, and great prices.  I don't have unlimited data on Internet, so Prime videos doesn't appeal to me.  I also hate that they push Prime on my home screen.  I feel that Amazon is no longer interested in my satisfaction...

They cannot go up against what Amazon is offering.

amazon	Robert V	2017-07-22T12:26:35Z	1	"Amazon is fast being a flea market of sorts flooded with far too many Chinese counterfeits over the past year. It's become too difficult to trust I will receive what I order from Amazon anymore, even when I order something ""sold by Amazon"", I seem to have a 50/50 shot of getting a generic substitute. Amazon is doing nothing to stop it. I'm switching to Walmart."

amazon	April R.	2017-07-12T18:27:48Z	4	I've been shopping on Amazon.com since they first came about (1994?) - and for the most part, they are fantastic. Every once in a while, a package arrives a date later than it should have - not the end of the world...I do have a few specific gripes, though. Why do they not have parental controls on Amazon Music Unlimited yet? This seems absolutely ridiculous to me - and if you do a quick Google search on this topic, you'll see a massive amount of unhappy people complaining. For parents, this is an absolute necessity, and a bizarre oversight on Amazon's part. My other issue is with Amazon Fresh. First of all, the price. Holy cow. It's a great convenience, but all the other local grocery delivery services are far cheaper. Also, it always seems like something goes wrong with these deliveries; whether it's all four of my bread items expire in three days from the delivery date, or half my order is delivered on time, but the other half is off in outer space and nobody can seem to track it down...I just can't figure out why these things aren't fixed by now. Train your people correctly. Track your deliveries. Easy stuff for a giant like Amazon.Other than those things, Amazon has been my favorite go-to online shopping place for many, many years, and I can't imagine it ever being replaced. Their customer service reps almost always fix your issues, and generally go above what you expected as a remedy. Their prices are almost always the best around (and you can always track prices via camel camel camel).
amazon	Baron Chiong	2017-07-12T14:01:50Z	1	I have been purchasing here for more than three years even though they don't deliver some items in the Philippines I give my friends and relatives' addresses in the US territory so I can purchase when they come home. Lately, I purchased three pieces Hugo t-shirts, two didn't arrived, worst the other one is FAKE!!! The material used is jersey and the spelling of the brand at the is wrongly spelled as HUOO BOSS. I wrote a review, unfortunately they didn't like and didn't post what I wrote. For me, amazon is the worst amongst the rest!!!!!  Purchase at FARFETCH and surely you'll get your money's worth and very happy with the assistance they give!!!!

I made an order and magically it ""got lost"" in transit and since then the price doubled on the same item. Unacceptable and shady. I'm sure it's a rare incident since I never had issues with previous orders, but it's not right to me. Not good. I also waited over 2 weeks for the item to become in stock, not impressed to have this happen.Customer service was advice me waiting all time, today almost 1 month - and customur service tell me   it is my problem because was order from third party seller, don't really understand why amazon advised waiting almost one month"

I also watched many shows and movies alone and with friends which brought me both entertainment and comfort at good and bad times.
amazon	Crystal A	2017-07-09T16:38:25Z	5	They were quick with my delivery.My second order was missed due to me not being home I was able to call and they said they always do a re-delivery up to 3 attempts.It was great I got my order on schedule.
amazon	Ernst Wrede	2017-07-06T08:50:18Z	5	A real 5 star company with real people behind the scene....I really think Amazon is fantastic. honest and their customer service is outstanding. Can not fault them. I live in New Zealand, and orders are prompt, issues are handled by real people and with real care. I have used them for a long time, and so do many of my friends. Miles ahead of Ali express and better than eBay. (which is not bad!) . Amazon.com, fair prices, great reviews and comparisons and customer centric. 5 star well deserved. Ernie New Zealand
amazon	Rebecca G.	2017-07-05T20:39:07Z	5	I have now purchased 2 items from Amazon- Male dog belly bands & female doggy diapers. Both packages arrived when I was told they would and were exactly the product quality as advertised and I am extremely happy with both as i hoped to be!! :)
amazon	Jay	2017-07-05T15:13:25Z	1	Ordered a Western Digital hard drive 30 06 2017 sold directly from Amazon . Tracking shows it originated in Southern France , no mention that it was anywhere than U K as they did offer next day delivery . Eventually arrived 05 07 2017 in single thickness cardboard no padding ,  arrived unusable although they have accepted return I now have to wait another seven days after their courier ( the dreaded HERMES ) to return the item  , so app. three weeks total ( that is if they refund ) otherwise back to trading standards , and still no hard drive . They are now on par with ebay .The reason I have posted the review on Trust Pilot , negative reviews against Amazon are not accepted on their site . Amazon really show themselves for what they are . They passed a return label to send the u/s item back and I was told the courier would call on 06 07 2017 to collect . Phoned Amazon met with laughter , ' thats done to keep you quiet '  take note prospective customers , if they send you rubbish do not expect to get your monies returned .  It is not possible to contact amazon uk at reasonable expense , there is no email address .
amazon	Charles Forsyth	2017-07-03T12:18:51Z	5	great experience. My whole life is ordered from amazon. Thanks!
amazon	Matty	2017-07-02T11:48:20Z	3	Though ordering and paying was easy, the delivery part was not so good. I ordered a book and it took almost 2 months to arrive.
amazon	Mercedees	2017-07-01T11:46:51Z	1	If I could give them zero stars that is what they would receive.  I purchased a headstone through amazon, the company that sold it contacted me for the engraving info.  I sent them the info and ended up purchasing the stand.  Due to all of the heavy rains/thinders storms the burial was pushed back.  We finally completed the burial, but was unable to set out the headstone in stand.  Once the rain subsided and the water went down, we then set out the headstone and stand.  When we had gone out to visit the site, the stand had fallen over and there was a crack across the top of the headstone.  The children were devastated as was I and they began crying, then of course I couldn't hold back, as the burial is rather fresh and still a painful time for us and we just want him to rest pecefully without having his resting place disturbed.  Upon inspection, the bottom screw had snapped off the headstand (after all it is welded on to a thin piece of metal).  Anyway, since the headstone and stand had no been setup and out there that long before breaking I started looking through my emails to contact the company.  I finally found them around a week and a half later or so...  Anyway, I emailed them they stated that could understand the headstone breaking, but not the stand and could I send pictures.  (Well, I couldn't understand it either)...  So, I sent pictures, they claimed they weren't clear, so I sent more...  I was then told to go to Lowe's and purchase screws, nuts and washers and screw it in, I let them know there were no holes and/or threads anywhere for a screw.  They then stated, well I don't know what you want us to do, you can purchase the items again a dicounted price.  Why should I have to pay for something that was obviously defective and broke.  I contacted Amazon and their representative told me that since this was a hard time he submitted the a-z guarantee claim for me and that I would receive a full refund within one week of the date of my initial claim since the sellers were unwilling to do anything and that I didn't have to do anything else.  Well a couple of days later amazon sends me another email stating they've denied my claim and that I should have contacted the customer first and I should have contacted them within 30 - 45 days.  I let them know that I did contact the customer first and it was within that time frame.  They then claimed well I should have returned the item and the customer claimed I contacted them after the 45 days.  Well, the customer gave them the last date of contact, not the initial date when we first began when I asked how do I get both items taken care of, as I had no address, return label, etc.  I asked the representative how are they denying me when I was already sent an email stating I would receive a full refund within a week of my claim.  They then told me they were closing my case it was their final decision and they weren't going to hear anything else pertaining to the matter.  I called in and asked to speak with a manager and the number to corporate, I was told customer service was their corporate and the manager stated that there was nothing they could do, since the claims department handles those matters...  They then had the audacity to email me stating you still have items in your cart, would you like to purchase them now, I deleted everything in my cart and made my purchases on another site.  I told them, I have spent lots of money and made multiple purchases in their site and the moment I end up with a defective product I am treated like it's my fault...  That's unacceptable, you can't stand behind your customers as you claim you don't need and/or deserve my business.  No, I would not reccommend because if you get a bad product you are stuck with it and out of the money you paid for it...

amazon	MOSES ABIOLA	2017-06-29T23:32:28Z	3	"AMAZON is great. One thing missing from AMAZON is their inability to promote books posted or published on their websites. I believe that this type of outlet should develop a format to introduce new entries to their published list, and to maintain such rooster continually for up to 90 days after posting of a new book title, (even at a small cost to the authors is acceptable). Doing so, does not translate to an endorsement of a book, rather informative to the audiences worldwide. The AMAZON prominence position them to champion this option. Because the idea of listing a book title on their portal, without publicity, is like planting a flower without intention to add water for germination. Development of ""AMAZON BookTV"" where such is platformed is no a bad idea considering the corporate standard."

amazon	ana pereira	2017-06-28T15:34:35Z	1	"Worst experience ever. I hope Amazon global realises the crappy service amazon italia is offering.Ive recently purchased a fan on their website and received the shipment conf. email on the 23rd of june stating it was shipped and going to be delivered on the 26th. On the 26th around 4:30pm i called TNT italia and was told amazon shipment never arrived. Amazon never bothered to contact me and said they'd would ""try"" to get it shipped asap. Also their staff member who clearly need a reality check as he thinks he's doing a great job should review his m.o. because being funny in a situation that requires a pro attitude isn't going to make him and the company look good at all. turns out that on the 27th the shipment was somewhere else to be delivered in another city and the customer service staff said this was a problem because when shipments go on the roll they can't be assured their machine read it well mistaking the CAP's. BS. aside it was promised this shipment would be delivered today the 28th and nothing has been delivered. amazon issued me a 5 € discount on my future purchase and tbh i don't feel like shopping there ever again plus i stayed in 1 day and a half, days i won't get paid at work to receive shipments that never arrived. my loss was greater than their petty tip of 5€ to my troubles. unacceptable."
amazon	CD	2017-06-28T04:53:11Z	4	Be careful of anything coming from China, etc., especially clothing. If it's not eligible for fast shipping, it's coming from overseas and the quality (and sizing, color, material... and pretty much everything else you can think of) is not going to be as expected. Also, the return policy will be impossible (you'll have to pay massive shipping fees to send it back, assuming they even allow returns).  But for anything we've ordered that was here in the US, we've pretty much always been pleased, whether it was books, electronics, or something else. Also, do check the star ratings of the seller. If you stick with sellers who have sold a lot of things and who still have a high rating, they should be pretty dependable.

Items could not arrive on time, it is ok, somehow acceptable. But clearly, Amazon should stop selling items that are out of stock! Amazon should remove the items from the listings immediately which are out of stock and should not deceive their customers like greedy monsters! It's not acceptable if next day dispatch on Prime ends up with a dispatch date 3 months later. By the time you can relax and enjoy the time sucking online chats and phone calls, which generally ends up like ""if you want, we can cancel your order""..YES please!!"

amazon	Debbie	2017-06-11T12:32:42Z	5	Amazon is my favorite place to order almost everything.  I am a Prime Member...worth the money.  I am careful about ordering from independent merchants.  However, when I had an issue with a merchant, Amazon helped to resolve the issue, and I got my refund (for an item that I never received).
amazon	Kika Shirayuki	2017-06-11T00:40:46Z	3	"I registered as a seller on Amazon as soon as I turned 18 and have been selling there for 4 years since then. In the first year I sold only a few items per day. Now I am selling hundreds of items per day and I decided to leave the university of my dreams to sell on Amazon. I would like to review the selling part of Amazon.The best thing about selling on Amazon is that there are no selling or listing limits and unlike on eBay, you can literally become a millionaire on Amazon in a few days after you start selling.The worst thing about selling on Amazon are their strict policies for sellers and no seller protection. On Amazon, you can be suspended for anything, there are thousands and thousands of strict rules and guidelines, which you need to follow and dozens of new, even stricter policies are being introducted every single day. The truth is, that the fraudulent sellers know very well, how to avoid being detected and usually it's the innocent sellers, who are suspended after a misunderstanding.What is the most typical thing about Amazon, which you will experience as a seller on daily basis are appeals. On Amazon, you will spend a lot of time appealing negative feedbacks, A-Z claims, suspensions, blocked listings, etc... It's really interesting, sometimes it's like a puzzle, you need to write the proper wording, and you will win. This is not like the stupid eBay, here on Amazon you are able to represent yourself in every case.I can give an example, what can cause your Amazon seller account to be suspended and this is not a joke. Let's say that one of your buyers, who bought a book from you, leaves you a 2 star negative review and writes ""my child slipped over and fell to the floor while carrying the book in her hand, otherwise the book was a good read"". Then Amazon suspends your account for a safety incident involving one of your products and asks you to write an appeal about how you will prevent such incidents happening in the future xDOn Amazon, you will not only struggle to follow all the strict rules and policies, but you will also have to defend yourself against all the malicious competitors. I have never seen anything like this, before I started selling on Amazon. If you are successful and your listings have the highest rank, the competitors will do everything to make your life a misery. They will be buying from you and leaving you negative feedbacks and reviews, opening A-Z claims or filling false infridgement claims. Some sellers on Amazon would kill each other if it helped them to get more sales.Also, as I already mentioned, there is a lack of seller protection on Amazon, the A-Z claims are never decided in seller's favor, they are always closed in buyer's favor and if you represent it properly, they are Amazon funded, so that you are not charged to refund the buyer.I would recommend selling on Amazon only to smart people. If you are not well prepared, you will just lose your goods and the payment. Amazon is not like eBay. And do not buy any stupid eBooks on the internet about how to become a millionaire on Amazon. No successful seller would ever share his tactics for success."
amazon	Darkspike23	2017-06-10T22:47:17Z	4	your money counts, they show a great value for their customers, if u get the Prime service their will rise the bar of a great customer service.
amazon	b s	2017-06-10T20:31:49Z	4	You know where you are with them, great customer service on the whole, vast selection and I love their new pick up option so that I don't have to stay in. I don't like that you have to have Prime for various benefits that were available before now though but that's fair enough, I can shop around. The website can be difficult to search sometimes, cluttered.

amazon	James	2017-06-09T11:23:58Z	3	Recently I ordered products based on the promise to deliver in two days being a Prime Member. However it has taken three days for the last three products to be delivered. One was promised next day delivery. It took two days.
amazon	David	2017-06-07T12:49:02Z	4	great experience , although order arrived a little late
amazon	Fritz Fred	2017-06-07T05:02:38Z	1	being a customer for decades, i have bought from them regularily and i had no problems whatsoever. in the last years the customer service has become mixed. sometimes it is good, especially if you call them and complain a lot, they do it right. in other cases customer service has become non-existent. they do not even respond to emails ignoring your customer requests.their return policy has also changed a lot. before it was possible to return anything. they sent a label and seconds after you took it to ups they would send you an email saying that your money was refunded.now they have updated their return conditions with 9 pages of legal language. as a result they do not return some products after all or they charge you a percentage of the price for returns. recently it also happened that they cannot deliver a package for no reason and instead of paying back the amount, they move the timeline for  delivery for one month telling you that you will receive the package in one month. most of the time you do not even buy from amazon. they inflate their revenues with companies from outside who sell for their own conditions. they call it marketplace. most people do not realize that. it gets more and more complicated and inconvenient ordering from amazon. i stopped using them at all and i buy only from excellent retailers with excellent service like costco, walmart and bedbathandbeyond. unlike amazon those retailers allow you to inspect the goods which you want to buy. they take anything back without a reason and without a deduction.i think amzn got ahead of itself focussing only on their inflated share price and no more on the customer.
amazon	LjS	2017-06-06T23:40:03Z	4	On the whole, I think that Amazon offers a great go to service for almost anything you may want or need. Sadly, there is a but..... if things go wrong the customer service team may not be as helpful as one would wish. I will still use this company as the positives of Amazon prime outweigh the disadvantages of one negative experience.
amazon	Eli Russki	2017-06-06T15:28:32Z	5	I love this company! They have the best customer service ever, super fast shipping, and easy to use website interface. It's my go to site for basically everything:)

amazon	komal sandhu	2017-06-02T05:23:33Z	5	I absolutely love amazon!!!!!! I can find everything I need there.I haven't had any problems with my orders mostly because I always make sure to read the reviews so I know if the product is as advertised. Its best to spend a couple extra bucks on a product that has a lot of reviews and customer pictures than one that has the same product but no review at a lower price. Most cases its still cheaper than in store.
amazon	Pero Petricevic	2017-06-01T20:29:37Z	5	Amazon Prime is wonderful... and dangerous.All issues that I have had with Amazon came down to the merchant themselves not Amazon.There is a reason more people have Amazon Prime than own guns in the United States.

amazon	Angela Chase	2017-05-29T14:19:46Z	1	They only publish positive reviews on amazon. Unfair, untrue company
amazon	Mikkel Petersen	2017-05-28T13:43:36Z	1	I purchased a computer mouse at an already scalped price (180USD), and the seller turned out to be an outright fraud!He passes off used items as new, and even worse, the customer service/A-Z Guarantee was utterly incompetent and essentially designed a situation where it would cost me more to return the item, than what I would be refunded.I don't know what Amazons screening process is for hiring, but every single person I was bounced back and fourth to in their utterly useless A-Z Guarantee just copy pasted the same damn answer every time, with a total disregard to what I was saying.And you very much get the feeling that you just land in a random Indian call center employed by people who don't care at all about their job, the customer nor Amazon as a whole.
amazon	Sitacanta Pattnayak	2017-05-27T08:24:13Z	5	Best e-commerce website to buy everything you want. They gave us quick service.
amazon	Abi Fz	2017-05-26T15:33:26Z	5	Great Sites. Everything is as ordered
amazon	Melissa Rios	2017-05-25T21:47:06Z	5	Excellent website to shop anything and great customer service .
amazon	JH	2017-05-25T08:07:49Z	5	Still my go to site for purchases when the need arises. Even when i don't purchase from them they are a good site to use as a price reference point. Using camel camel functionality (a tracking price comparison tool) is great when you aren't in desperate need of something but would buy it at a set price.
amazon	IHeartOnlineShopping	2017-05-24T19:43:04Z	5	My experience with Amazon since 2001 has been fantastic. I have never had a problem that Amazon did not take care of. I like purchasing items from Amazon even if they don't have the lowest price because they have a straightforward, no hassles return policy. Over the past couple of years, I have noticed an increase of counterfeit products popping up on Amazon. Most recently I had a problem with three electronic devices I purchased failing (they were power surge protectors over $100), and I contacted the manufacturer for replacement of the items under their warranty, it turns out that Amazon wasn't an authorized distributor of the items, so I thought I was out of luck. I contacted Amazon and they made good on it quickly and easily. I have had to return items for various reasons over the years, and Amazon offers the most hassle free returns of any company. I love their pre-paid labels for defective/not as described merchandise because it saves me time, money, and hassle of waiting in line to have packages weighed at the post office just to return merchandise. Our household is Amazon Prime members and we love Amazon Prime, Prime Video, movie rentals, and also have recently started using Prime Now. I find that sometimes the prices on Prime Now are cheaper than on Prime, so you definitely want to search around on both sites prior to making an order to get the best price. Prime Now, even including a generous tip for the driver saves us $10-$15 on average per order, so if it's available in your area, I would definitely check it out. If I could change a few things about Amazon, here is what I would change: 1) Stop letting knock off merchandise to be sold on the website. I have ordered items in the past that claimed to be Disney branded items, only to have them arrive and be low quality, print on demand items that are not official Disney merchandise. 2) Keep the fake DVD's off the website. I received Lion King 1 1/2 from Amazon that looked authentic, and I called Disney about a problem with the disc (there was only one disc and the menu mentioned a second disc) and it turns out that it was a bootleg copy of the disc. Disney took care of it on their end, but this seems to be the new norm with Amazon and I would like to see things go back to the way they used to be, without all the fake merchandise. 3) Make the pricing across Prime services competitive with the rest of the Amazon website. Sometimes you can buy an item for $5, $10, or even $15 dollars cheaper on the Amazon website if you don't use Prime. I would like to think that Prime gives me a great bargain, but that does not always seem to be the case these days. and finally, I would love to see Amazon clean up their review system. There are far too many unverified reviews on there, and even more products that have hundreds of reviews that are fake, bought, paid for, etc. Amazon has tried to combat this recently, but there is still a long way to go. I don't buy anything on Amazon anymore without checking the website Fake Spot to find out if the reviews are paid or not prior to making a purchase. Amazon has it's ups and downs, but hands down they are the best online company there is. I order 10 times more merchandise from Amazon than I do from any other store, and I have the least amount of problems with them compared to other stores.
amazon	Ricardo Morales	2017-05-24T18:14:31Z	5	A shop with very good assortment good prices both in the store and online very good quality in the products

Excellent customer service, if you ever even need to use them (rarely) Great prices, just an easy place to work with. Amazon.com is super user friendly. Anyone not using them, should.
amazon	Ben	2017-05-19T01:57:18Z	5	Amazing customer service, fast delivery & their businesses outside of the USA are also a breeze to deal with - especially if you already have Amazon Prime!

amazon	Riccardo Mecozzi	2017-05-17T13:00:17Z	1	I have paid an extra delivery service to get the mattress before 12:00 a.m.The delivery didn't take place and there is no way to get information on the status via the tracking number. Both the Amazon website and the delivery service report that the delivery is on going. The marketing of Amazon in the delivery creates issues.

amazon	Jonathan	2017-05-16T17:41:02Z	4	Support is good, a lot of cool stuff as a prime member, the only thing that annoys me is that something can be a good price, you add it to cart, come back later for checkout & bam! The price is now a rip off! Seriously that needs to stop, I know its a trick Amazon does to get more money..
amazon	Tanika	2017-05-16T07:23:04Z	4	Always good to know there are companies like this that value their reputation and know how to keep it stellar. Great business that delivers on time and you can communicate with easily if you have any problems

amazon	Eric	2017-05-05T18:55:55Z	2	Prices are higher than they used to be and shipping is slower than molasses. More than once things have arrived damaged because of poor packaging. I only use them if I can't find something elsewhere.
amazon	Grimace	2017-05-05T09:40:04Z	1	Has anyone purchased this product recently? I placed an order in March and Amazon have stuffed up the delivery twice now! I will be lucky to receive the correct product by Christmas at this rate!!1st delivery attempt - Amazon didn't log my shipment properly, so someone else got delivered my item mid April. 2nd delivery attempt - I got a nice surprise today and received a completely different product! Amazon are currently investigating why customers have been receiving the wrong product. They have advised an uncertain timeframe for receiving the product now. Amazon customer service have been very unhelpful with making things right - no thanks to Abhishek and your supervisor. The least they can do is offer an equivalent, in stock product to the affected customers while Amazon sort out their issues. There is also no ability to escalate the matter to a regional or national customer service manager. Update - It is now 19/5/17 and my replacement order has not shipped yet. Don't know why it's taking so long. Amazon are not providing any updates or reasons why their service is soooo bad...I would have given a 0 star rating if there was an option.Awesome Amazon.
amazon	Lupe R.	2017-05-04T18:50:34Z	4	The best place to shop, always get my products like i want it

amazon	woodpecker3	2017-04-30T04:57:56Z	1	They filter you comment and feedback and don't let you say what you want. 1984 style control. Amazon does not give you freedom of speech. Even when you say it in a nice way if they don't lie your review they refuse to post it. Stay away from this horrible internet monster.
amazon	Jamie from California	2017-04-29T08:06:54Z	5	They always have great selection. Customer service is great!
amazon	Estabn	2017-04-28T19:15:26Z	4	The prime system is great but what Amazon doesn't say is the fact that if you want Amazon Fresh and Prime you have to pay twice 15$. Not once as it looks like. Which results in $30 per month..
amazon	Olga Creutz	2017-04-27T14:26:30Z	5	My orders are always in time and I'm happy with the service!
amazon	Dany Sochurek	2017-04-26T20:51:42Z	1	Horrible customer service! I've been striving to activate my seller account for the past 3 weeks and I'm just receiving random declination emails all the time. This is really ridicoulus! Giving up on this bullsh*it and moving back to eBay.
amazon	Ales Hass	2017-04-26T16:34:08Z	3	Amazon needs to stop jacking up prices because a 8 dollar thing becomes popular and over night it almost 20 dollars. And forcing customers to purchase a certain amount before taking them to the check out screen. Not cool. You are getting greedy
amazon	George Church	2017-04-26T10:06:57Z	5	Superfast delivery, great customer service. Thank you

amazon	Alan	2017-04-20T16:14:28Z	5	What more could be said about Amazon.com except to say that I can find 99% of the items that I search for and if they don't have an item then one of their partners has it.Searching/browsing is easy, ordering is quick and deliveries are on time.  Customer Service is friendly and fast as resolving issues.  I've had to work with them twice, due to failed deliveries, and they fixed the issues immediately.
amazon	Nairoby De Los Santos	2017-04-20T15:17:57Z	3	I find amazon is no longer as great when it first started blooming. Packages don't arrive at all or don't arrive withing the prime time. Just no longer a big fan.
amazon	Thierry CABARET	2017-04-19T20:12:37Z	2	"Very often displayed ""in Stock"" and finally not...Poor delivery Service in France due to bad suppliers (low cost)Since I payed 50 euros for Premium Services, 66% of case there is a problem of delivery.This time good was not delivered and finally announced delivered to a neighbour but my office is in a industrial area and not neighbour especcially after 8pm !!!After claim conversation with Amazon, they asked me to investigate who could have received my goods, and they promised me to call me back in 2 days...unbeleivableTime before it was a Premium delivery between 7 and 10 PM àat home and the guy (in fact a taxi driver) call me to wait him in the street !!!That is the new Amazon in 2017 !"
amazon	Megan	2017-04-17T17:13:33Z	5	I'm a prime member and it's worth every penny. I've been using prime now for groceries and it's extremely convenient. That, plus the huge selection, price, and shipping times, it makes it extremely difficult to shop anywhere else.

amazon	Stephen Marcum	2017-04-12T18:02:10Z	5	I have purchased everything from pc parts to car parts through amazon. No real issues that could be pinned on amazon. Just check who the seller is and where the product is being shipped from, this will solve many issues before they present their ugly heads.If you find yourself on amazon a bit, look into amazon prime. Amazon prime can get you better prices and free shipping on a large portion of items. It also includes a large selection of movies you can watch on the go.

There are times where even if they don't offer the best price, I find myself ordering them for the quick delivery times and guarantee that I won't have any hassle from the seller.

amazon	Frankenpunk	2017-04-06T22:29:49Z	1	"I revised this review after learning that Amazon have engaged in book banning. You can find out more about the books Amazon has banned by searching 'books banned by amazon'.  The other reason is basically Amazon's behaviour towards taxation and the poor.  Read the article here for more information truthdig.com entitled ""amazon-battles-seattle-and-loses""PROS1. Generally good returns policy, but they don't always refund full postage and you can be caught out on some items with 30 day returns policies.  Read the samll print.2. Goods usually despatched quickly3. Local amazon locker delivery point helps avoid playing catchup with couriers4. Good customer service, but quite a lot of room for improvementCONS1. It's a corporation that tax-dodges and only cares about money. Meaning we profit a big company when we buy from them instead of a small trader. For most people I imagine we shop there because we're trying to make our money stretch, and Amazon tends to be cheaper.2. Their packaging tends to be very wasteful. Huge boxes to send a small item etc. However, their packaging feedback is good, and I saw my feedback taken onboard on subsequent orders of the same thing.3. They could do more to help customers filter out non-Amazon traders to help avoid ordering items that end up being sent from China for example.4. My partner used to work for them and I hear working conditions and pay were not great.5. There is too much room on Amazon for dodgy traders to mislead the public e.g. some Chinese companies presenting themselves and their products as 'European' e.g. listing states ""ships from Germany"" when it actually ships from China.  Such products tend to have prices that are way more than the quality would suggest and often have a few 5 star reviews singing the praises of the products.  Such reviews rarely match the real life quality of such products, which is often poor, suggesting that the reviews are false.  Amazon could do more to stamp out this practice of misleading consumers into buying Chinese junk.6. They have started banning books that criticise or bring into question Zionism and related Zionist propaganda.  Such books are often scholarly works, well researched and evidential.  But Amazon globally have adopted a pro-Zionist policy and I've personally stopped buying stuff via their websites as a result.7. Many of their employees are so poor that they have to survive on food stamps (USA)"
amazon	randy callahan	2017-04-05T21:04:17Z	5	i have ordered many items from amazon and never have had to call customer service. i had to call on this last item because of the shipping date i have amazon prime so i get two day free shipping but the two day free shipping said it was going to take five days even though they had the item in stock? hmmmm. when i called it only took less than two minutes to get ahold of a live person, this person helped me out, i mean she went above and beyond any customer service i have ever dealt with. she was able to have my item shipped and delivered in two days. i will always buy my things from amazon. THIS IS THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH...... thank you..
amazon	Larry Simms	2017-04-05T09:44:55Z	5	I used to buy most everything with ebay but now most purchases are with amazon. The prime program is unbeatable.
amazon	Ken S	2017-04-04T20:55:26Z	5	I've been an Amazon customer for many years, and have bought enough items to occasionally have a problem. In every single instance, Amazon has been fantastic about resolving things in my favor. I'm a fan for life.
amazon	JAMES	2017-04-03T16:20:07Z	4	The only problem I have ever had with Amazon is the deal that when you buy a Kindle you are automatically charged for Amazon Cloud useage after a few months without prior notice and even when you do not use it. It took two phone calls to customer service to get the charge reversed and added back to my bank account. Other than that ordeal, I recommend them to a lot of my family friends and clients on a regular base. I still use them for a lot of things as they take care of you when a company that sells through them messes up on an order and that means a lot to me.
amazon	SC	2017-04-02T21:58:14Z	5	Never had a problem with this company. Their customer service is impeccable. Will use for many years to come and will recommend to anyone!
amazon	Aken	2017-04-01T21:51:16Z	5	Still the best !
amazon	sarah	2017-04-01T21:17:18Z	5	Amazon is the best for buying/selling things that I have ever used.Even though the price is more pricey than like i don't know Ebay.Its a trustworthy site that delivers within a few days unlike Zaful.And the product for me at least is always what was promised.
amazon	Marcia Jordan	2017-04-01T20:54:39Z	4	I have spent lots of money with Amazon and have always loved the thing I get. Also love how fast it gets to me,  normally  2 days.
amazon	R. customer	2017-03-30T16:39:44Z	3	This was not the first time that I have ordered from this company...The Pantry box way to order foods is complex...it says to order 5 items to fill a box...I ordered 7 qualified items, beverages & snacks, to be qualified for free shipping, it still charged 5.99 to ship to my home...MmmI'm a Prime member, I pay a yearly fee, I am perplexed. :( R.

amazon	rachel milleo	2017-03-25T02:39:53Z	5	I don't know what took me so long to become a Prime member but it is worth every penny!  By far the best online shopping bar none! Prices are right and packages arrive on time and in tact every time. Thank you Amazon, you save me time and money.
amazon	Kyra Webb	2017-03-25T00:11:59Z	5	Amazon is amazing! I find great deals on there. Subscribe and save is such a great tool. Amazon Prime is one of the most valuable things I've spent money on.
amazon	aukratiaphol kilandruwa	2017-03-24T11:22:42Z	5	"With exemplary customer service, nice prime option and wide range of options - online shopping has never been so fun & relaxing.  Only piece of advice - ""keep 3rd party fraud sellers"" as more they scam people through amazon,  more impact will be in amazon 's brand name."
amazon	Jack Gordley	2017-03-24T02:07:30Z	4	if you have amazon prime (basically a must have) then you get two-day shipping on any amazon store front or associated store front their pricing ranges from great to meh
amazon	Liv	2017-03-23T22:18:29Z	5	So easy and so reliable
amazon	Brian Sykes	2017-03-23T16:11:46Z	4	Just received my latest order from Amazon.  As always, it came promptly, well packed and at the right price.  How a business should be!
amazon	john	2017-03-23T12:41:46Z	5	You'll never go wrong with them.
amazon	Robert	2017-03-22T20:41:34Z	5	I would send love letters to Amazon if I could.  They are the best online marketplace bar none.
amazon	Susan Marschall	2017-03-22T02:13:05Z	5	I have to give AMAZON my best of the Best 5 stars. I have been a member since 2010 and a Prime Member for about 3 years and while I have come across some problems such as late deliveries, or deliveries to the wrong address so I have to check with neighbors things of that nature, for that bit of aggravation, I do have to say their Customer Service is second to none. I always deal with very pleasant Customer Service reps and if I am not satisfied with their answer to my question or problem I then ask for a Lead and I am 99% lucky in that area that they will usually listen and treat me with respect , see where I am coming from and grant my wish. Only time they have their hands tied and I do agree and understand where they are coming from is if it is a merchant that the item in question is from then I have to wait to get an  email back from the merchant before I can go further. They do have an A to Z Guarantee which doesn't always work unfortunately but More times then not it does and I am happy for it. So for those who have had a not so great experience just know its happening to others but you just have to keep on top of them as I do and look at their awesome merchandise, daily deal etc. You can't go wrong.
amazon	F.M.B	2017-03-21T09:48:07Z	5	Amazon.com is easy and safe to use. The delivery is fast. I prefer items sold by Amazon.
amazon	Ashlee	2017-03-21T07:41:06Z	5	i only buy from trusted companies and i have never had a problem. My packages arrive nice, neat and timely. If not timely even through no fault of amazon they have credited my account to a discounted price of the order more than once when postal issues come about during the delivery. They always try to make things right I have used this site to order things from phones,computers,tvs,kids toys, movies, watches, decorations, party supllies, etc you name in 15 years I have got it hereYour Prime member truly Ashlee
amazon	Khoi Pham	2017-03-21T07:01:12Z	5	Credible company with excellent customer service. I got scammed once by a third party seller, yet they still refund my money!
amazon	Cyrus Alavi	2017-03-19T20:21:10Z	5	Always quick and efficient
amazon	Robert roberts	2017-03-17T11:18:15Z	5	I have been shopping at Amazon for a while now and they're so great they have good prices I have never had no problem I have never had nothing back and I will shop there in the future thank you and have a great day
amazon	Joey	2017-03-16T03:33:58Z	5	I am a prime member, i love how fast they deliver their item. I wish all of their sellers are using the prime service, I can't complaint items delivered in 1 or 2 business days at most. and I can return any item that doesn't meet the description without providing any reasons
amazon	Karl	2017-03-14T17:55:45Z	1	"I had the misfortune to purchase a TV through Amazon, after 3 weeks the tv became faulty, I reported the problem and offered them the chance to repair it, after countless emails chasing them up to collect it, they failed, to do so, it took 2 months for them to collect it. After 1 month waiting I gave up and asked them for a refund as I had reported this fault within their 30 day policy. Amazon emailed me back to say I was entitled to a refund and this would take 1 to 2 weeks. That was 3 months ago.... Since then continuous emails from me to resolve this and broken promises from Amazons customer service. On Saturday they emailed me and said they had organised a refund and this would be all sorted in 3 days. Now 4 days later, my neighbour has informed me they have just dumped the TV outside my front door in the pouring rain, visible to all passers by, knowing full well that I am currently away. Their email footer says ""earths most customer centric company"" I think not it should read ""least"" instead of ""most"" I must have spent 20 hours of my time and sent well over 30 emails to Amazon to resolve this. I couldn't be more annoyed and looks like my only option now will be to take them to court. If they can't process a simple refund in line with their own policy they shouldn't be in business."
amazon	Yusuf	2017-03-14T15:30:43Z	4	I think, complaining here won't get you very far–– give the feedback directly to amazon, there you will be helped and it will have more impact
amazon	Kasper	2017-03-13T16:49:21Z	2	I ordered books on amazon as they were half the price they would be had I bought them from somewhere within the EU, even after import taxes. When they arrived the package was in a bad shape. Upon opening it I saw the books were bent out of shape due to water damage and the pages wrinkled.I therefore requested a replacement from Amazon.com, this was not an issue and I was pleased with their return policy other than the fact I had to pay the majority of the return shipping costs myself (about 30 euros). Even with these extra costs the books were still cheaper from Amazon than from anywhere in the EU and I was in no rush so I was still very pleased.However when the replacements arrived it immediately became apperent that these too had suffered water damage, albeit to a lesser extent than the first ones. At this point asking for a replacement once again would put the total price of the books and return shipping over the price of simply ordering them elsewhere and I decided to cut my losses.Amazons return policy was good, their shipping quality less so.TL;DRReceived damaged books from amazon, payed shipping to replace them, received new damage books.
amazon	RoyalSnowman	2017-03-11T01:44:54Z	5	As the title says. They delivered my twitch streaming compuer very fast! Would use again
amazon	Raj Jahenzab Kahn	2017-03-09T23:46:47Z	5	I love to buy amazon because they have the fastest shipping. Free amazon prime for students I use to ship all my stuff. I recently needed to get a lacrosse ball for practice and I got it so fast. Thank you amazon
amazon	Stephanie Lawson	2017-03-09T04:57:39Z	4	I've been shopping with Amazon for years, and it's a great, expedient company. I order from them very regularly, and rarely incur a problem they don't strive to fix.I recently (just last year) decided to sign up for Prime since our household uses Amazon almost on a weekly basis, and while they offer lots of great perks in addition to the faster shipping (TV shows, movies, discounts, etc.)  it seems as though the amount of items they host that are Prime eligible has lessened as the program has gone on. Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like when I signed up, virtually everything on their main site was eligible for Prime shipping, and now it seems to be at the seller's discretion (when a third party seller is involved.)As a whole though, great company! And the annual cost for Prime is definitely worth it for the perks you get.
amazon	Elias Maven	2017-03-07T18:22:36Z	5	Very Good company
amazon	Austin	2017-03-04T19:37:57Z	5	As an Amazon Prime user who frequents both the Instant Video function and the main wesbite I can say - to a tee, this is one of the best services i've ever dealt with.Customer Support - 10/10      Customer Support Staff seem to always go out of their way to try and help you with an issue, and the majority of the time will compensate you for your troubles. I was given 1 month free of Prime for my RX480 GFX Card being 2 days later than it was supposed too.I was given 2 months free of Prime and a full refund for a product being over a week late.Instant Video - 10/10     No issues with load times and/or buffering. Streaming Service works well which is better than some others.ConsAmazon sellers and Amazon themselves have to pay people to deliver your product, these people tend to be the only issue in a well oiled machine and are an issue with any online retailer.
amazon	John Parlero	2017-03-02T18:25:46Z	5	Good prices in all documents
amazon	Natasha	2017-03-02T04:42:41Z	2	Ordered on february 18. Charged me in a few days, delay. Then apologized, offered priority shipping with no extra charge. At the same time charged me saying they didn't. And still delayed. I never thought I would be disappointed in amazon. I ordered twice from them before and i was content. I wonder what happened to them.Update - shipped on 10 march, gave a discount, on 17 march i received my order. Money returned. So everything turned out well but how nervous i was.

amazon	Renee Eubanks	2017-02-14T18:53:34Z	1	Amazon is by far the worse buying experience of all time. It is so messed up and if you are not prime, forget it. Shame on you Amazon. Very messy. Room for great improvement. Take prime members only and stop wasting the rest of us is time.
amazon	Vikki Wood	2017-02-13T22:32:47Z	5	I spend thousands of dollars annually Amazon and apart from the vast offerings, the service I appreciate most is Amazon's help with the rare bad buying experience. All companies have the occasional customer service glitch or even the really bad transaction. It's how companies respond that distinguishes them, and Amazon in the few instances I've contacted them has always quickly remedied the situation, and in some cases totally exceeded my expectations. I know I can trust Amazon with every purchase I make. Also I love, love, love Amazon Prime video!
amazon	Mohammad Houri	2017-02-13T21:27:07Z	5	Especially the free returns with prime

amazon	Annie Co	2017-02-06T17:08:49Z	1	I was having problems charging my Kindle Fire HD and contacted customer services for advice. I was told I should contact them via chat to sort out a replacement.I did this and was told I should do a backup then factory reset. I expressed my concern, that I would lose docs/photos and game progress but was reassured I would not. So, stupid me, believed the customer service representative.I have lost all my documents - some very important ones, photos and all my game progress (I'm not a gamer, but enjoyed playing a game and had got quite far!) .I contacted customer service, several times, getting standard responses, and not an offer to try and sort out this problem. I am furious, that I specifically asked if I might lose items but was told I would not.Customer service take no notice of anything you ask them. They apologise, but this is of no help!
amazon	Richard Smith	2017-02-06T07:40:02Z	5	The delivery is good too.

amazon	Michael	2017-02-02T03:38:40Z	4	pretty good site but not always lowest - should look around
amazon	Meric S	2017-01-31T16:47:39Z	5	Always attentive, responsive and (if needed) compensative. I never like to pay extra for something for fast delivery that I can have a few days later under usual circumstances but I never regret being a Prime customer and paying the annual subscription fee. Amazon for the win! :)
amazon	Davide Sala	2017-01-31T16:29:57Z	5	Simply the best customer support ever!!They are always kind and gentle, they listen to you and do everything they can to help you. I really buy everything from them because of the customer support, even if the price sometimes is not the most convenient I still prefer Amazon than any other online store. Thank you Amazon!
amazon	TIMOTHY HEFFERNAN	2017-01-28T20:32:46Z	5	I have boughten many great items from Amazon and feel great to be able to find what I'm looking for with easy to find items at the best price. I also have the Amazon Prime to get the free shipping in less than two days. I highly recommend Amazon.Com to anyone looking for the best sales.
amazon	Harrison Wells	2017-01-26T15:45:13Z	3	I've ordered many things from amazon.com and never had a problem. shipping time is fantastic, good quality, everything is great! The only problem I've had is with their third party sellers (Marvelio). I ordered something from them thirteen days ago, and yet to receive it! Amazon.com would be perfect if it weren't for Marvelio, and were they to stop letting Marvelio use Amazon as their main storefront, then I would change my review and make it perfect! I also looked up three different review websites, and they had at least one-hundred bad reviews about Amazon because of Marvelio. That being said, I love buying from Amazon, Amazon's shipping time is great, and their quality is great!
amazon	Leslie	2017-01-26T00:13:38Z	5	Needed to get a new phone but was unsure which one best suited me.  I loved the fact that I could easily see all the features of the phones and compare them side by side so I could choose the best one for me.  The samsung S4 mini won hands down for me.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase. It came on time and as described.  When I ordered the accessories for it, there was an issue but thanks to Amazon, I was refunded my money without any huge fuss and able to order the correct item shortly after.  I am extremely satisfied.
amazon	Teresa B	2017-01-25T23:02:45Z	5	I have been with them a couple of years now. They have made my life easier, being a Prime member. delivered to my door in two days. And some many things to choose from. Go Amazon,

amazon	Sharlotte Wilcox	2017-01-18T00:42:21Z	5	I have never had a problem that a rep could not efficiently and kindly solve. There delivery is always accurate. Also no problem with the packaging. Just one time an item came from Japan. I did not like it plus it took along time arriving. They gave me a 50 per cent refund because it would have cost to much to return it. I really have absolutely no complaints. I trust  them thoroughly.
amazon	Aranda	2017-01-16T08:28:50Z	4	Aaaaaaaaaaaa, I can't believe, your site is a quite quick and safe site. The service is so goooooood. I'm so sorry for the wrong words and bad English, but I can't stand to express my excited. So thanks to your site.

If there are ever any issues with any purchase their customer service team will help and make it as smooth a process as they can to resolve. They offer the feature to call you straight back so its not even at your own cost.
amazon	paulie03	2017-01-12T18:14:17Z	5	I just signed up for Amazon Prime and it's been great! I even had an order not fulfilled and the process was easy and effective to complete my order. Highly recommended.
amazon	Dawn	2017-01-11T20:51:58Z	4	Amazon is a good online retailer but I've found their prices to be a little higher than ebay's. I usually don't buy from Amazon anymore since every time I do a price comparison, Amazon is higher.....on everything. But it's still a good place to shop.
amazon	Liz Peterson	2017-01-11T15:39:37Z	4	I love and order so much from Amazon.  I also have the Prime, the only thing I don't understand is how they are making any money when they can't get the items to you in two days.  I've had this happen several times which they do make it right by extending my Prime a month at a time.  That's where I think they would be loosing money.  I think they should adjust their shipping days.  Or post because of weather in other states it could delay a persons order.
amazon	SM	2017-01-11T04:24:06Z	5	I love to shop at Amazon.com as regular basis because they are most efficient and best shopping place at online. I will hoghly recommend anyone to shop here. Their refund process at prime is hassle free. Excellent customer service and you can get thing so quick on time.mmost of all they are trustful online source. I am feeling good to be Prime member enjoying my shopping every time. I love Amazon service.
amazon	Vincent Tyler	2017-01-11T03:21:04Z	5	It was a pleasurable experience buying things on Amazon.com. Fast delivery, good service.

amazon	Steven Berry	2017-01-10T20:49:29Z	4	"First off I love Amazon. Amazon.com has saved me on gifts, tools, supplies, everything. After having been saved by Amazon so many time I began to notice that knowing what you want before showing up is a big help. In fact Amazon isn't really a place to browse or research; the ""but"" in the title is for that. Know what you want, the more exact the better and life is beautiful in Amazon-Land."
amazon	Alecia	2017-01-10T04:32:41Z	4	I must say i have enjoyed shopping. Big choices, fast delivery and the absolute best customer service I have ever encountered. Especially for such a huge company. Will never stop buying from them.
amazon	Joe Boadle	2017-01-10T01:03:15Z	2	Use to love this brand but with cost saving measures like paper lid that sticks to the plastic bowl and vegetables in the bowl instead of in a packet, which causes them to fall out when you open the hard to open paper lid,  you've lost my business.
amazon	Klaus	2017-01-08T17:31:41Z	5	Amazon is amazing and one of my favorite sites / places to shop. So many options. Cool things to find and you know the service is ALWAYS stellar. Even when I have had issues with a product arriving damaged Amazons vendors have taken care of it with no problem. Amazon makes sure their vendors take care of Amazons customers. Incredible to have that kind of trust in a company today, when most companies skip on customer service or care what happens to their customers after the money has been paid.
amazon	Jake Hanson	2017-01-06T17:41:45Z	5	Ordered diapers at 5pm and they arrived the next morning at 8am! That's insanely fast!

An Amazon agent in the Philippines took my description and ran with it! Using my description and the wattage, she found a compatible bulb in minutes! In less than a week, I had three replacement bulbs to fit my defunct lamp! When I need a product, or anything under the sun! I'm with Amazon for life!
amazon	Chris Wilson	2017-01-05T19:02:41Z	5	Best experience online, everytime. Buy two or three things per week from there.

amazon	Jill C	2017-01-04T13:59:27Z	5	I'll be an amazon customer for life. They actually care about your opinion. I've only had an issue with an order maybe twice since I've been a customer there for years and both times they did whatever it took to make me happy. Bravo! I really don't know why I shop anywhere else. I think I'll quit. Prime it is - all the way!
amazon	Tom Lim	2017-01-04T07:21:36Z	5	I have been using Amazon for years and years! I can honestly say that I have not had any issues. When I've had to make returns I have managed to do that using their online resolution centre easily and as I have followed their guidelines, have received a refund with no problem!
amazon	Maun Flanagan	2017-01-03T05:00:12Z	5	The best co to deal with, fast fast shipping. I have ordered at 10 pm and had delivery by noon the next day! )Not any special shipping )Customer service excellent and alway a human with phone calls! I buy almost everything there now.
amazon	John Oredake	2017-01-02T21:46:55Z	5	I bought some items on Amazon and had to return them.The return process went great and my money was refunded the same day.
amazon	Patricia Frederick	2017-01-02T02:43:17Z	5	I've been a Prime member for years. It pays for itself within a month. I love the variety and selection. I love the fact that I get just about everything for free in two days even more (and usually only $3.99 for next day)!
amazon	Donna	2016-12-29T15:21:45Z	5	I specifically would like to review Amazon's textbook rental.  The entire process was smooth and the books arrived in great shape. I have two sons in college, and we have tried other companies. That experience made me appreciate the organization and professionalism of Amazon all the more. We will use Amazon for all of our textbook needs next semester.
amazon	Ken Petersen	2016-12-26T03:06:16Z	5	I own a couple of Kindles and have had some issues with them. I was living in Vietnam, in the middle of nowhere, when my newest kindle stopped working. I heard they had good customer service, i chatted with a rep for more than half an hour while he tried to figure out how to get a new Kindle to Vietnam, they had to be creative. I received a new Kindle 5 days later and a return sticker fully paid.Wow, amazing!
amazon	Shimaa	2016-12-23T15:53:13Z	1	Been having nightmare experience with their customer services from emails to phone calls. It's been 2 months that I have been trying to get someone to help me. How can you have a customer service department that is only connected to the accounts department via email. The accounts department is unreachable!Absolutely ridiculous. Of all my shopping experiences Amazon has proven to be the worst nightmare there ever was.Annoyed!
amazon	Dick lawrence	2016-12-22T20:56:16Z	1	"Is the US open for business? The answer is certainly NO and a big NO too. Many many times I have tried to buy from amazon.com and ebay,com from US sellers only to see the message ""the seller will not ship to your country""The irony is you can buy Russian CDs and videos from a US seller on amazon.com but you can't buy things made in USA or things from private US sellers. Friendly lot what? Don't believe the lies about US legislation stopping you buying things on amazon.com either because for most amazon.com items such as CDs and leisure goods it simply does not apply."
amazon	Gina Suchy	2016-12-21T04:07:57Z	5	I have ordered from Amazon for years the few problems I did have they responded to very quickly. The Amazon prime 2 day shipping is a life saver. Prices are reasonable .I would  suggest googling the item you are looking for first then click on to the amazon site . I have found the selection of items is much better most of the time compared to using the amazon search bar I have no idea why.
amazon	Marie	2016-12-20T19:38:00Z	5	I love Amazon, seriously - it saves my butt all the time!I have Prime, and being able to have things at my door within 2 days is the best this ever, especially for someone who doesn't remember birthdays until 2 days before hahaha. Also, most stores will price-match Amazon prices, so if you're in a store cause you need something faster than 2 days, you can check the Amazon and get the price from there. Also, I think i only have one problem with an order and they had no delay in fixing everything for me.
amazon	L.C.	2016-12-18T10:50:02Z	5	Never a problem in 17 years with a lost order or late order.  Excellent service and  easy to use website.
amazon	Howard Paul Shore	2016-12-18T02:46:44Z	1	Amazon Is Worst Than My Bank!I did write a letter back on Friday, October 7th, 2016 and they 100% Ignored It, until about a week before my Small Claims Lawsuit Court Date.Anyway, here is the Whole Story:I have been a victim of Amazon Online Fraud about one (1) year ago through Amazon and their company was able to take care of it for me, however, their Fraud Team obviously did NOT take enough precautions because about one (1) week ago (and we are talking about late September to very Early October of 2016, I suffered from their Amazon Fraud Again and when I reported it to their Customer Horrible Service Department, they told ME to just Change My Password and when I Changed The Password Over The Phone With One Of Their Representatives Still On The Line With Me, there were at least Two (2) More Fraudulent Charges Of Somebody Trying To Purchase Two (2) Additional $50.00 Dollar Gift Cards.Their Horrible, Non Caring Customer Service Department then tried to Freeze My Account until further notice and told me that they would Reverse The Fraudulent Charges Over The Phone On A Recorded Line and even give ME a Generous Credit Applied To My Account For The Harassment, Humiliation And Fraud That Occurred On My Amazon Account For No Good Reasons.The Reality:  Sadly, the Fraud Charges have Not Gone Away and there is NO Generous Credit Of Any Amount Applied To My Account Either which I am Very Angry And Upset About to say the Very Least!Please NOTE: The situation has ONLY Got Worst!Furthermore, maybe about one (1) week later, I re-checked my account again and also Noticed That There Are An Additional Three (3) $100.00 Dollar Fraud Charges that have just been applied to my online account without my permission or legal consent for the dates of: September 16, 2016 and August 25, 2016 and August 25, 2016.September 16, 2016 Gift card claim (claim code xxxx-xxxxxx-GG34) $100.00August 25, 2016 Gift card claim (claim code xxxx-xxxxxx-AYHU) $100.00August 25, 2016 Gift card claim (claim code xxxx-xxxxxx-JNL3) $100.00I am beyond angry and upset because Amazon Has Allowed This Illegal Fraud To Go Through, Regardless Of How Many Times I Change My Password.Please NOTE:  Since Amazon Did Not Reimburse Me For The Fraud Charges And Properly Apply An Acceptable Credit Of Compensation To My Account For The Negligence That They Recently Caused For The Second Time In A Row In One Full Year, I Did File A Small Claims Lawsuit Against Them at the Los Angeles Superior Court And Have Pictures And Screenshots To Show The Judge And I Can Also Subpoena The Past Records To Show Amazon's Past, Disgusting Continuous Negligence Of Allowing Fraud To Go Through And Continue As Usual.Amazingly, around Thursday, December 15th, 2016 which was one day before my Small Claims Court Date against Amazon, I did receive a voicemail from Ms. Lizette Fernandez from Amazon's Legal Department (206 435 9880) lizettef @amazon.com who had several conversations with ME and despite all of my honesty and proof that I was a Victim Of Fraud, her response back to ME was that Amazon is Not Responsible For Any Type Of Fraud Resulting From Their Customers regardless of whether it was their fault or Not!I was very angry and she was unwilling to do anything, however, I did fax her all of my documents that I had for court since I was Not Able To Make It To Court since I am out of the country and am hoping that she will reimburse All Of My Money Back To Me, Once And For All and then we can go our own separate ways!Today is Saturday, December 17, 2016 and I am supposed to hear back from Ms. Lizette Fernandez from Amazon's Legal Department by this coming Friday, December 23, 2016.  If I do Not Get An Honest And Fair Resolution From Amazon about the Fraud Debits Being Reimbursed Back To My Account, then I will Refile The Small Claims Lawsuit again when I get back to Los Angeles by the beginning of August of 2017.  No Problem!For The Other Social Media Websites, I will enclose Pictures Of My Recent Gift Card Balance Statements for their reference and further review.  Thank You.
amazon	Mark	2016-12-17T20:01:41Z	5	What can I say?  Amazon does everything as perfectly as humanly possible.  Prime is great, and if you do a lot of online shopping you should definitely sign up.  To be able to get almost anything within 2 days with free shipping is amazing.  I hate going to stores (I am male after all), and the cheap prices aside for most things waiting 2 days is just as good as getting it right now.  And the extra benefits of free Prime videos and shows, music, etc. make it a no brainer.I have never had something go wrong that, as long as I contacted them reasonably close to the purchase date they have not gone out of their way to make right.Most of the third party sellers are reputable.  I have had some disappointments with shoddy products that did not show up for some time with them.  But those have been rare.Amazon is definitely, to me, the gold standard for online retail.  Given their success I am sure I am not alone.Also, I have their FireTV which makes any cable box look like a piece of garbage.   I would definitely recommend it as well.  It goes great with Prime videos, Netflix and any online streaming that you would watch on your TV itself (which is how I want to watch my content).
amazon	Ricardo	2016-12-15T19:12:11Z	5	Really good and smooth experience. Delivery on time. Keep up that good job!

amazon	Melissa	2016-12-12T01:48:51Z	5	I have ordered many items from Amazon over the past several years and have always been a very happy and satisfied customer. They have great customer service and are there to help you in any way. Love this company.
amazon	Jeremy Lansford	2016-12-11T20:32:00Z	5	"Amazon drops their prices every year.  If you read their company filings or look for them at the SEC website, they specify how much they lower prices each year as a result of efficiencies/productivity gains they put in place through greater scale or ""pricing power"" with suppliers.  The lower prices drive greater market share so pricing can drop further, and a virtuous cycle is established.  My wife has Amazon Prime, and we make around 40 purchases a year with them.  None of our purchases have ever been damaged due to packaging/handling issues.  Though the rise of Amazon may be death knell for many smaller competitors, I recommend them highly."
amazon	Barbara	2016-12-11T02:50:41Z	5	Amazon is the greatest. I am an Amazon Prime  Member. And, for $100./yr membership  i get soooo many benefits. It is truly a fantastic company. Everyone should give Amazon a try. Its better than any cable company. You pick and choose what you want to watch and when you want to watch  them .you also get free 2 day shipping on any orders.( prices are fantastic).You get thousands of movies; thousands of songs, . You can upload all your stuff from your phone to your tv. You can see all your photos and view all your videos on your tv. You can play sooo many games on your tv. And sooo much more.Amazon is a Great Co.
amazon	federico	2016-12-10T06:51:57Z	3	i'm from italy and i usually try to avoid amazon.it.just cause it sucks. really hard.instead i try to buy from amazon.co.uk.would go for 1 star amazon.it and 5 stars amazon.co.uk which makes an average of 3 stars for the company
amazon	Steve	2016-12-09T17:46:03Z	3	Bought a selection of items for family back home, all set to deliver to the UK (was sure i did this through Amazon.co.uk)Find out that somewhere along the way they randomly charged me 92.50 for Amazon Prime. Once i spent 30 mins and a couple of transfers on the phone, i got it refunded, but its just as well i checked my pending transactions online otherwise I might never have know they'd charged me, for a Prime account i dont have too. Fast resolve but shouldnt happen in the first place with this much money.
amazon	Mike Matthews	2016-12-07T16:33:46Z	2	I ordered an item from the US site for delivery to the UK and asked for it to be sent in sturdy packaging, which I was assured it would be. When it arrived it was in a simple padded envelope and was damaged. This happened on two more occasions and in the end I gave up. The only plus was that Amazon refunded me in full.
amazon	Shireen Sweiss	2016-12-06T13:19:27Z	4	Been using amazon forever now and I love it. They provide a great if both products and prices, the reviews are always accurate and when buying clothes the 'actual fit' section helps tremendously. I do get lost sometimes and end up spending hours there filling my basket with things I never knew I needed. But I have no one to.blane but my self for that one, I'm sure we've all been there...
amazon	Kent Munthe Caspersen	2016-12-05T23:08:40Z	1	"I signed up for some Amazon computing service more than a year ago with a ""free computing"" offer. I got the impression that I would not pay anything without actively buying a product later on. I had to provide my credit card in case I would later decide to buy or extend some service, so I did.I forgot all about my free Amazon product, until they started charging me after 12 months. Now, when closing my Amazon account, I can see that they still got my credit card registered, and when clicking ""Delete"" on my credit card, they tell me to ""go to their main website and then click Manage Payment Options."" I cannot find a link on their website or a menu item with that name, and I am now afraid that there is no way to stop their recurring payments. If anyone from Amazon reads this review, can you please confirm that you have deleted my credit card information and cancels all of my services, subscriptions, accounts, etc. at amazon.I can see that you have now changed the phrasing on your website to make it more clear that you will get charged after the 12 month period which is nice, but in the same time, I think you should have sent out emails to all users registered during the period of the old phrasing. I would also have liked to receive an email that emphasized that my free tier would soon expire and move onto a monthly billing subscription."
amazon	Giorgio	2016-12-05T23:01:15Z	1	Se state pensando di usare amazon per i vostri regali di natale, forse questo vi aiuterà ad evitare qualche brutta sorpresa. Da qualche mese progettavo di regalare al mio ragazzo una stampante 3d per natale. Avevo passato ore a leggere recensioni in giro sul web e finalmente avevo trovato quella giusta. Proprio oggi faccio l'ordine e pago anche un extra per la confezione regalo. Nell'ordine aggiungo anche dei rotoli di filamento plastico di vari colori che tuttavia non riesco ad aggiungere nella stessa confezione, decido quindi di chiamare il servizio clienti di amazon.it . Una ragazza mi risponde e mi dice che NON SA se sia possibile farlo (teoricamente è pagata per saperlo) e mi consiglia di cancellare l'ordine e rifarlo da capo. Mi rassegno e annullo l'ordine per poi rifarlo senza però risolvere nulla. Richiamo  Amazon.it e un ragazzo mi dice che non è possibile fare un unica confezione e che quindi devo pagare l'extra per la confezione regalo per ognuno dei 5 rotoli di filamento plastico che avevo comprato, più la stampante. Ero arrabbiato ma il meglio doveva ancora venire. Per ragioni ancora oscure, Amazon decide di richiamarmi per chiedermi che ne penso del loro servizio clienti. Solo che invece di chiamare il mio numero, regolarmente registrato sul mio account, decide di chiamare il numero del mio ragazzo che era tra i dettagli del destinatario della spedizione. Ovviamente non si sono fatti sfuggire l'occasione per dirgli che gli stava arrivando una stampante 3d rovinando in un second una sorpresa progettata da mesi. Mi hanno offerto 5 euro per compensare... chiaramente ho rifiutato. If you are planning to use amazon for your christmas presents, maybe this is going to spare you a  bad experiences. I was planning to buy a 3d printer for my bf since a couple of months. I have spent a lot of time reading thousands of reviews and finally i found the perfect choice. As you can immagine It was not easy to do all this keeping the secret, but i made it. I placed the order on AMAZON.IT today, paying an extra for a gift wrapping and adding also a few rolls of plastic filament in various colors. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to create one single gift box, so i decided to call amazon and ask if it would be possible to put the filaments I have just ordered in the same box with the 3d printer. A young lady on the phone told me she didn’t know if it would have been possible (she was supposed to be payed to know these things i guess) , and suggested me to cancel the order and do it again. I tried without success. I called again amazon.it customers care and a young guy told me it was not possible to have a single box, so i had to pay for a gift fee for each of the 5 rolls of filament, plus the printer. I was really upset but the best were going to come. Amazon decided (for reason I cannot understand) to call me back to ask me if I was satisfied of their customer care. The problem was that they decided to call me not on my phone number but on my bf phone number which was written on the shipping details. Moreover they told him about the 3d printer and my surprise so was completely ruined. They offered me 5 euro as compensation  which of course i refused.
amazon	Lacey	2016-12-02T21:15:53Z	4	Great finds on Amazon .com sometimes can't ship to Canada which makes shopping frustrating but still like how easy it is to shop and pay with gift card balances
amazon	Jane Stern	2016-12-02T17:02:54Z	1	I ordered a Frye handbag last week. It arrived. It stank, the seams were open and frayed, it was missing the logo tag, the change purse.It looked like something rejected from Goodwill. The off shore customer service rep did not know the word, seam, or thread, or logo and was unable to understand the problem. He send me an RMA form and said i would be credited but it will take 30 days.I then ordered the same bag from Zappos for 150 dollars more. The whole business felt like such a fraud that I called 6pm, called Zappos and called Amazon who owns them both and literally no one I spoke to could understand what the problem was. I am annoyed I got used and damaged merchandise, that I had to replace it and spend twice the money, that I am annoyed my CC would not be credited for a month. I spent 2 hours on the phone with people who could not understand the problem. The people I spoke to at Amazon corporate had no idea that Amazon owned either Zappos or 6pm and kept redirecting my back to calls back to them. I am fed up.Edit
amazon	Prince Jordan	2016-12-02T12:05:00Z	5	Don't know what else to say. Living in New York City right next to a shipping center means fast shipping for everything I order. Same day if not next day for most items. Sometimes I think this is a bad thing as it makes me buy so much crap I probably don't need. But if you need something fast, this is the only site you need.
amazon	Mike P	2016-12-02T09:29:52Z	5	Amazon is the premier marketplace for all your shopping needs ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
amazon	Jonathan Dybkjær	2016-12-02T08:57:41Z	5	Always quick response on email. When a auto-renewel charged me 75 USD, Amazon didn't mind to cancel it and transfer the money back to my credit card. Great customer support.
amazon	Mikael Larsen	2016-12-01T12:27:57Z	1	"Very dubious business ethics on par with how bad Ryanair used to be, e.g. ""free delivery"" posted all over and then you have to sign up to an ""auto suck money from my credit card"" scheme that many people forget to cancel. Just one example - FIX IT!!!"
amazon	Abby	2016-11-30T20:05:40Z	5	I am an Amazon Prime member and I cannot say enough good things about customer service. Every issue I have ever had, the have addressed and made it better. I can order even from the market place and know that the amazon guarantee covers my purchase if I am unhappy. Will keep ordering from this company.
amazon	Rob	2016-11-29T13:28:24Z	1	1. I singed up as a seller2. Amazon withdraw $49.99 from my CC3. I Can't list my items4. I contact Amazon and ask why. They say that Amazon no longer approve new sellers in my categoryWhy not let SELLERS know that BEFORE they sign up.Now they offer me a check as refund. They refuse to refund to CC. It would cost me over $15 to cash that check since i'm located outside of US.They are scammers!

amazon	Keela	2016-11-25T18:58:47Z	5	I love Amazon.com. It has grown so much and the company seems to be making improvements each time. I have tried almost every new shopping experience from there. I do not use Amazon Fresh because I personally find it too expensive and I do not mind going to the store, BUT Amazon Pantry is amazing. I have tried it and I love the filling up the box idea. Their customer service is fantastic. I very rarely have issues with Amazon and if I need quick help I call their Customer Service line. I also enjoy that you are kept up to date on deliveries. My one and only complaint, which is more of an eye roll moment, is that I do not like the carriers used to deliver our items. USPS or UPS are completely useless and I have had bad experience with both. If Amazon can get their own carrier to deliver their goods then I have a feeling it would be a perfect service.All in all I love Amazon and I will always look there first for my shopping needs for awesome items and prices.
amazon	Shernette Whyte	2016-11-25T07:18:19Z	5	I am presently not in a situation where I am able to purchase books as I feel - but usually save towards a particular title I want. But I love reading romance stories and while saving that money for my next book - I love to roll through the free books and the low-cost ones of new and upcoming and even established writers.ProsThese books are easy to find and all I do is buy and add to my Kindle reader and I am able to enjoy a particular title at leisure. ConsNor sure if this is an issue with Amazon or what the authors upload to the website - there are times a page or two may be missing. That is sometimes where the story is really interesting or presents some background to what happens next.

I have only had great service, an immense number of products to buy, the delivery is a fast two days with Prime Membership and the products are for the most part good quality.  The few times I have had to contact Customer Service they have immediately taken care of the issue.  Amazon.com rocks and I highly recommend.
amazon	Sam	2016-11-22T20:44:18Z	5	I love Amazon. Their Prime Membership is most definitely worth it. As I receive everything in 2 days or earlier.Plus hundreds of free movies and tv shows. Best of all, You can find almost anything you are looking for on Amazon and shop around for the lowest price. They have easy returns. And now have a trade in feature. Which you can use to trade in old electronics, books etc. And put the $ toward that new item you want without having to come out of pocket as much. Check It Out!

amazon	Manue	2016-11-20T23:21:44Z	5	"I have been ordering on Amazon for ever. For 8 years to be exact and believe me when I say that Amazon is the best site for online retailing that was ever created. Not only do you find everything ""I'm not even kidding, you literally find everything on their site"", but you also have access to the best, the top, la creme de la creme of customer service. Amazon value their customers. Whenever a seller tries to scam a customer, Amazon always protects the seller and get them a refund. I'm a faithful customer and won't be looking anywhere else :)"
amazon	Anthony Perham	2016-11-20T13:06:23Z	5	"I am not going to rubbish this company, as I don't think they are rubbish, I have bought hundreds, if not, thousands of pounds worth of goods from them and will continue to do so. However, my complaint is with the Amazon Echo/Dot. I live in the UK and recently purchase a Dot thinking it would be everything I need.Wrong! And sadly so. No matter how I speak to this thing, it rarely understands what I'm saying and it has been programmed to sound human in the way that she will reply, ""Hmm, I don't seem to have the answer to that one."" And to be quite honest I'm getting totally sick of hearing this phrase and similar ones.I think a major part of the problem lies in understanding what I'm saying. And to this end I contacted the dedicated Echo Dot department who sad to say suggested I go through the 'voice training' ... Sad because there isn't a voice training facility to be had. There apparently is supposed to be one, but there isn't.If it did exist it would be 25 phrases for the user to use in trying to get Alexa to understand what your asking. I found an email address for the CEO of Amazon who apparently stated for all to see, ""If my customers are not happy, then I am not happy' (or words to that effect) It also said that he was very hands on and gave out his email address because he valued his customers input and apparently dealt with these emails himself? I sent one asking for help seeing as his dedicated Dot help centre could not, so far he has failed to reply. I think it's been four or five days now. The other maddening thing about this Dot is that she/it appears to know very little about the UK? One example of this is that I genuinely forgot a name of a television presenter and asked Alexa, ""Who hosted 'Who want to be a millionaire?'""It replied, ' Chris Harrison'.I had by this time recalled the name I wanted and it obviously was not Chris Harrison. So I asked it,  ""Who is Chris Tarrant?"" to which it/she replied, ""Hmm, I don't know the answer to that one.""So my point is, we have a gadget that appears to be geared up to answering questions concerning America ... In the UK?Actually, I think I've had enough now. I am going to accept the possible loss of £50.00 and disconnect this annoying useless toy. Maybe if ECHO grows up, then so to will its little boy, but until it does, I'm done with it."

amazon	Tinaya DaughterandservantofmySavior Sallie	2016-11-11T20:37:08Z	4	I have been an Amazon customer for years. I order numerous products all throughout the year and their selection is PHENOMENAL. I am almost ALWAYS able to find what I need on the site. They offer brand new, refurbished/reconditioned and used products. The site is easy to navigate and has detailed, easy-to-use search options. You can save many items onto a personal wish list and also add items to your shopping cart to purchase at a later date, and you can add several shipping addresses and different payment options to your account.My most recent order included a Dolamee D5 brand Android TV box. I also ordered a wireless keyboard/mouse/remote combo to go along with it. I was under a 30-day Amazon Prime trial and so I got Free 2-day shipping on both items. (I was also able to find a HDMI to RCA/AV converter box on Amazon, since I have an older TV) All three items came within the 2-day shipping time-frame and they were packaged well. Everything worked like a charm with no problems whatsoever. Amazon always sends me reminders to review the products I purchase and I often do. In the rare case I ever need a replacement or refund, they make the process as simple and easy as possible. Amazon customer service is pretty good. They respond to my inquiry messages usually within 24 hours or less. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because there have been instances where the customer service I received resulted in an unfavorable outcome. This is extremely, extremely, rare, however, and does not occur anywhere near often enough to keep me from giving the site a high rating. I plan to continue to be an Amazon customer for many years to come.
amazon	Jack Will	2016-11-11T02:08:09Z	4	I rarely catch a discount on a product I want, but I like the package deals – you save a bit with them. I use Amazon for buying clothes, shoes, gadgets  and even imported chocolate. I’ve never had a problem with the delivery.
amazon	Scott	2016-11-10T16:40:44Z	3	So much for the guaranteed 2 day delivery...Amazon continually fails to provide prompt delivery service...they love to blame the carrier...but when you order before 3pm EST they are to ship it that day - now sometimes htey ship the following day and it will get here in 2 days...but i've had WAYYYYY too many times where i had 2 day delivery and it takes 3-4 and when you look at the tracking info, you realize, amazon didn't ship it till 2 days after i placed the order....im no longer a prime member as i really have no idea what im paying for...
amazon	Adela	2016-11-10T11:26:03Z	4	Almost always cheaper than in a store. I am considering getting amazon prime now
amazon	Alysia Hobbs	2016-11-09T14:59:06Z	4	Great prices and always revive what I order on the dates provided . They have a great tracking system on the whereabouts of your items.
amazon	Sean	2016-11-07T22:26:37Z	5	Having an Amazon Prime membership makes it so great! Just thinking about that item that you need to go to the store for, but never remember to when your there... Amazon makes that a thing of the past. Right when it's on your mind you can order right then and there. Ordering on Amazon you can be rest assured that the price you pay isn't way overpriced or unavailable. Having the Prime membership also ensures that you will get your item in at least 2 days. Not to mention you get free membership add one w/ your Prime like music, storage, movies, tv shows.... all free with that membership. Amazon has the right idea. That's the best $99 I can ever spend a year, and am happy to do it when it comes around!! Great job Amazon!!
amazon	Daniel Levinson	2016-11-06T16:15:25Z	5	Great selection, great service, great return policy, never had a problem that wasnt resolved.
amazon	Maxx Williams	2016-11-05T07:48:41Z	4	In this day and age, it's very convenient to be an amazon prime member. Not gonna lie, my membership ran out at one point, and I thought I would be fine without prime. Turns out, it's worth it because you end saving more money than spending (shipping, etc).Plus, if you have a student email address, you get a discount!
amazon	Donna H	2016-11-05T02:53:27Z	3	I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of experiences with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only good thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.
amazon	Jhonatan Sarmiento	2016-11-04T01:01:03Z	5	Simple and every time the best customer service ever.
amazon	Lisa	2016-11-04T00:45:16Z	5	"I am very thankful for this site It has any and everything you could possibly want!! very fast service no more than 2 or 3 day delivery and goes on. customer service is Awesome! if something is wrong with an order or what ever the case may be their going to fix it they treat you like are priority"" I love that in a company  and you want that it keeps you coming back."
amazon	Joe	2016-11-03T21:20:19Z	5	I have been a customer for over 2 years.  Everything I have ordered has shipped fast and been as promised.  Could not be more happy paying my year subscription for Prime!!
amazon	Lone Thimsen	2016-11-03T19:14:16Z	5	Ordered a book and I received it 10 days later much earlier than expected. Everything went smoothely👍
amazon	Aki	2016-11-03T14:20:55Z	5	It's crazy how much stuff I buy from Amazon to run my business. I honestly couldn't operate without it, especially due to prime. I can't tell you how many times I've run out of something but been able to keep going as I could get some more of that item the next day.
amazon	Kiley adams	2016-11-02T15:59:42Z	5	I like amazon! Very quick delivery and good website! Easy and good recommendations
amazon	Dr Richard Kimble	2016-10-31T19:25:52Z	2	Amazon offer zero help when a seller does not dispatch an item. Amazon only ever allows you to contact a seller, so when it is fraudulent activity they have no interest in getting involved. I recently purchased from a fraudulent company via Amazon and they refuse to ban this seller despite tens of reviews from other buyers citing the same activity - shame on you Amazon
amazon	Rox.	2016-10-31T18:25:59Z	5	All the items that I've bought, were delivered on time and in perfect conditions.
amazon	Becka	2016-10-28T22:40:27Z	5	I am a professional shopper. I shop for people as, well as for my family.  Since I am a Prime Member, I get free 2-day shipping, as well as Sunday deliveries!! I will tell you, review your sellers!!! If you get a good seller, give the recognition, so they can provide others with good service too!!
amazon	Ann Pedersen	2016-10-26T11:35:16Z	1	There is no phonenumber to contact for people living in Denmark. My card is being charged by amazon without me beeing a customer at Amazon.com. I am trying to reach customer service, but it is impossible. The only number I can find is one in India and a toll free uk nuber that can not be used from Denmark. It is a horrible customer service! Please let me know how to get in contact with the amazon customer service from Denmark. Kind regards  Ann Bouisset
amazon	James DePass	2016-10-25T16:50:55Z	5	Whereas one may have specific issues with shipping and sellers, I have never had a bad experience with Amazon.com in the 9 years I have been a member!
amazon	Carla E.	2016-10-22T03:34:26Z	5	I love the ease of ordering anything from groceries to clothing and receiving it the same day. Customer service is always great
amazon	P. Piggy	2016-10-20T18:59:54Z	5	I order a lot of things from Amazon.com to be delivered to the UK. Customer service is by far the best of any company that I have ever used, UK companies could well learn from them.Examples I ordered a dvd boxset in their xmas sale, over 18 months later I began to finally start watching it and found 2 discs were the same and so one was missing, I contacted CS thinking there would be nothing they could do, they immediately shipped me a replacement.They usually shipped products in really sturdy packaging occasionally items have been damaged in transit but this is usually down to courier/UPS, if you contact Amazon they usually reply within the hour and they have always sent out a replacement without having to send back damaged items.Can't fault their service, UK companies need to learn how to look after your customers, amazon.uk is good but .com is even better.
amazon	Lawrence Pierce	2016-10-18T19:56:01Z	1	I've been ordering from Amazon for a few years. All shipments from all vendors, including Amazon, have gone to my account address that I attempted to use today, but which was rejected as an address the product could not be delivered to. The product was a package of three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, shipped directly from Amazon.When I used Amazon chat to inquire about this, I was sent boilerplate about hazardous materials and oversized/overweight products. But these were three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, so the issues put forth as an explanation were nonsensical. Next, I asked for a supervisor, but was told the supervisor would simply give me the same explanation. I was, however, asked if I would like to bypass my Prime membership shipping benefits, and use freight forward with Fed Ex.Since the product is a small package of vacuum cleaner bags with a shipping weight under one-half pound, all of this complication over shipping was obviously the consequence of mismanaged metadata at Amazon for this product. But since the Amazon representative was both stubborn in securing more sophisticated support from a supervisor, and was suggesting I could have the product shipped without using my Prime account, it all felt like a scheme to solve a problem at Amazon by getting me to accept their dysfunction and pay unnecessary and inappropriate shipping fees.
amazon	Steven Allcock	2016-10-18T19:41:46Z	1	Well i have had an awful experience from a company that i would usually trust!!I order an item from amazon.com that i couldnt get in the UK and had it shipped to a fright forward company to be sent onto me in the UK.The freight forward cost me $80 but i thought it would be worth it.When it item arrived it ha been so poorly packaged that is was smashed into bit but best of all it was totally the wrong product!!Amazon USA were then washing their hands of it as i had used a freight forwarder even though THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ITEM.I now have to pay myself to return this item and get a refund but i am out of pocket $120 now in postage for an incorrect item!I normally rave about amazon but amazon USA are horrendous and extremely rude, i had 4 web chats disconnected as i didnt agree with the script they were telling me!!!!Never again will i use amazon based on this experience and their incompetence.
amazon	Customer	2016-10-18T15:48:56Z	5	Always on time with every order, unbeatable!
amazon	Jo K	2016-10-17T16:12:28Z	5	I've had amazon prime for about 6 months now.  The unlimited next day free delivery is excellent and has saved me a fortune.  The amazon video is quite good although the variety of programmes is not too extensive, but it's excellent if you like the amazon exclusive programmes.  Amazon music does not have anywhere near as much music on it as spotify or deezer, but it comes free as a perk, so for that it's quite good and you can download music to listen to offline so that's pretty good.
amazon	Dave Wiloch	2016-10-15T20:08:17Z	5	I have been using Amazon for years and have spent thousands of dollars on merchandise. I have never had a problem with the way Amazon runs their business. The very few times I had a problem with my order Amazon's customer support took care of it instantly. This is what you want with an online retailer, GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.
amazon	Kay	2016-10-15T17:35:54Z	5	This company has the best priced products and customer service.  Awesome company.  Order more from Amazon than any other online company.  Can't say enough positives about it!!!
amazon	Yvon de Kruijf	2016-10-12T20:50:54Z	5	The reviews were very helpful in determining which material to buy.

amazon	annalove	2016-10-10T03:46:35Z	5	Amazon is one of my favorite site. You can find everything you want here and cheaper than that in the store. Prime member enjoy 2 days free shipping. I love amazon.
amazon	Tony	2016-10-09T17:55:22Z	5	Maybe it's the best website for finding everything you need, they are very professional and the delivery is so fast. Can you image live without Amazon?! Really!
amazon	John	2016-10-07T15:07:05Z	1	I have been an Amazon Vendor for 10 months using their FBA service. What a nightmare. First, they never really explain their actual fees, yes it is my responsibility to figure it out but it is nearly impossible until you receive the bill afterwords. The biggest issue is that I discovered another vendor selling our branded product without authorization. When I informed Amazon all of my products where deemed to have been damaged in their warehouse. A claim was filed and after 3 weeks it was determined that they were not damaged just defective all of a sudden and I only had 8 days to remove them or they would become the property of Amazon. After more than 2 dozen pleading calls to explain to me what was defective I was suddenly told their was nothing wrong with the inventory. I received a call from the Executive Resolution Team and was told as a 1 time courtesy they would reimburse me for the 2 items Amazon had lost or will be selling themselves in competition with me. I asked about being compensated for the lost Revenue over the previous 2 months or about getting the inventory storage fees waived but was told that even though it was completely Amazon's fault and they could not explain how they could have such a series of mistakes it is their policy not to reimburse any vendor.I am in the process of winding down all business with Amazon and hoping to be able to retrieve all of the remainder of my inventory and close all Amazon accounts.While it is ok to buy through Amazon, I would never recommend them as a sales channel. As I suspected before opening an account, only Amazon makes money even though our products carry a 200% markup it is all consumed by Amazon fees and unreimbursed issues.As a vendor their are much better channels to sell through.
amazon	Victoria B	2016-10-07T08:08:29Z	5	Love them. We had an Amazon Prime membership for the past year, and it just recently expired less than a month ago.  WE ALREADY MISS IT!  Their 2-day shipping was AMAZING! Most of the time, things arrived THE NEXT DAY! LOVE LOVE LOVE AMAZON!  They're the best EVER!!! :)
amazon	Gina Chu	2016-10-06T22:25:46Z	5	With a busy store and growing business it helps to be able to pick things out online and see them next day with Prime. Prices have started to rise and you can sometimes find a better deal elsewhere but overall it is the best choice for ease of use.
amazon	Stephen G	2016-10-06T06:07:05Z	5	Excellent service.Very helpfully if problems arrive.
amazon	Mikkel Søgaard Pedersen	2016-10-05T13:53:26Z	4	Everything went as expected, and I received my books the day after I placed the order.
amazon	Maxine Lewis	2016-10-04T19:06:11Z	5	I love Amazon.. There's so much variety of various things which are much cheaper than eBay & in stores.. Delivery is fast & very reliable 10/10
amazon	Frank	2016-10-04T15:53:07Z	5	I ordered three books from amazon and they arrived in less than 24 hrs. Very happy with the experience.
amazon	The Moonlit Quill	2016-10-03T21:59:05Z	5	No matter what I need, or the desire of my heart, I can typically find it at a great price on Amazon. I love the addition of Prime Shipping, and love that I can receive my orders within two days of ordering! I've purchased hundreds of items across a myriad of departments on Amazon, and have never EVER had an issue with returning an item that didn't fit or was not as described. I'm so grateful for Amazon, and recommend my friends and family to shop on Amazon for all their online shopping needs. Years ago, I used to shop on eBay, and found that the whole auction thing was actually kind of fun. However, I ended up having issues with fraud in my PayPal account, and realized that this would continue so long as I was forced to use a middleman to complete my online purchases. With Amazon, there is no middleman and never has been any fraud in my debit account that can be traced back to an Amazon purchase. They're very protective of their customers' financial information, and refunds are quick and easy. I will never, EVER shop eBay again, especially in light of how many scammers are starting to infest eBay's sellers market. It's really too bad that eBay doesn't do as good a job at protecting their customers as Amazon does. Thank you Amazon for being so awesome!
amazon	Subha	2016-10-03T21:05:35Z	5	1. No retailer could be better than Amazon2. May be (as far as I know ) greatest online collection of every possible merchandise category.3.

amazon	Ju Lynn Lee	2016-10-03T01:46:34Z	1	No. This is the second time i've purchased a kindle. The first time the kindle (kindle voyage) stopped responding 3months after the warranty period expired. I have to purchase a new kindle on my own to replace it. This one, has a line on the screen, 2 weeks after purchase. I literally woke up and found a small line on the screen when i reached pver my bedside table for it, despite not dropping it, nothing fell on it and the kindle being the only thing on the table. My kindle was still within warranty, so i contacted kindle support, explained to them, hoping for some support as I am concern that the little line will cause systematic malfunctioning. HOWEVER, all the customer service officer (his name is Arif) cared about was whether or not it was a physical damaged and that my warranty doesn't cover that damage despite that I had done nothing to cause it. No care about my concerns, nothing. Just offered a replacement which i had to PAY for. NO I will not being buying another kindle device if i can help it. They are fragile and Amazon know it, they won't try to replace your device even if you're in the warranty period, they will try to swindle you to buy another. Enough is enough. Don't get your hopes up if you need a replacement, they will try to pin it on you.
amazon	Nate	2016-10-02T04:52:37Z	5	Ive bought off amazon a hundred times and never had a bad experience and I buy used things from time to time, the customer support is very prompt A++
amazon	Pawel Stefanski	2016-10-01T15:58:58Z	5	For years now, our entire family has been buying books and other goods at Amazon.com, as well as selling some (mostly books).  Their customer service is in general excellent and they always have been able to resolve any issues, which were few and far between.  Considering the enormous volumes of business the company deals with, they are as close to perfection as it gets. I have no hesitation recommending them.
amazon	Bruce Montgomery	2016-10-01T10:46:02Z	4	Most of my online shopping activity is related to amazon. I love their Prime 2 day shipping. they also have some very attractive prices.  Unfortunately, their customers support is sometimes quite slow.
amazon	S Matthews	2016-09-30T12:39:37Z	5	I am a Amazon Prime member and I am so pleased with the prices, customer service, and their incredibly fast delivery!  The best membership dollars Ive spent this year... FANTASTIC!
amazon	mark dowd	2016-09-28T23:36:07Z	5	Amazon customer service are without a doubt the most helpful I have ever talked to, this is even more surprising when you consider the size of the company. Any problems I've had with packages being lost have been dealt with swiftly and they even upgraded the shipping speed for the replacements.
amazon	ZAZAZ	2016-09-28T00:01:35Z	1	They don't allow me to submit a bad review for bad item sold by Amazon.
amazon	Stanley Foo	2016-09-27T09:01:07Z	3	I've ordered from Amazon several times in the past year, but the purchasing experience varies. Products fulfilled by Amazon, such as Kindle Paperwhite, were well received and packaged. However, there have been misses as well, such as a gorillapod fulfilled by a third party seller on Amazon. It was a cheap knockoff and Amazon somehow disallowed me to post a negative review on their listing for this product. Felt so cheated!
amazon	Sweeta B.	2016-09-27T07:33:47Z	1	I ordered on Amazon Shoes Kevin Kline in August. ordered a size 8.5, I received a size 7. I wrote that they did not come to that size, I sent mine, but I'm at his own expense to send back the wrong size. I spent time and money on it, though it was their fault, not mine. August 22 I sent, and on September 1 to a track number order was already theirs. September 20 I received a message that the order they received and I have written off more times the amount delivered. I have them write a bunch of letters, I simply ignore. It fraudsters !!!!!! Return the money!!!!!!
amazon	Mary Sinnathampi	2016-09-25T16:30:19Z	4	makes my life so easy. hopefully they can add more things in prime
amazon	AA	2016-09-23T23:55:46Z	1	Poor CX, delivery late and prices aren't all that
amazon	Kerim Ignasi	2016-09-23T15:31:16Z	5	Amazon are always really good
amazon	Supriya	2016-09-23T04:51:50Z	1	Order. 205-8968507-7992324I ordered a birthday gift for my dad from Amazon. Being a Prime Member I made sure the product that I purchased was a prime product with next day delivery. The item should have been delivered on Wednesday it is now Friday and still no delivery. Amazon have sent out the prime product using standard Royal Mail who have informed me there would have been no way for the item to get to me on Wednesday unless Amazon paid for special delivery which they have not. The birthday was on Wednesday Amazon why are you trying to be cheap and post a prime product via royal mail. Yet another failed Amazon prime delivery when you really need it. Good gob Amazon.
amazon	Mrs Margaret Airey	2016-09-21T13:34:56Z	5	I trust amazon for a vast array of goods they are so trustworthy in delivering on time and have a great returns policy. They are also good for Christmas gifts not available in my local stores.  A wonderful online shopping experience.
amazon	Stephanie McCormack	2016-09-20T21:35:44Z	4	I am an Amazon Prime member. I love the TV opportunities that are available with my Amazon Prime membership as well as the 2-day shipping. Icount on the reviews that are available and before I purchase things
amazon	Wayne E. DeBee Jr.	2016-09-20T13:12:13Z	4	Fast ordering, Fast Shipping with anything you need.
amazon	Priscilla	2016-09-15T07:08:54Z	5	I am a consistent Amazon shopper, it has so many things i want or need and for the most part receive it in less than 7 days. I've purchased large items such as furniture to small things like vitamins and i've never gotten ripped off
amazon	Maria Hughes	2016-09-14T06:22:55Z	5	These shoes look fantastic. It's only as comfortable as I expect a fancy, high-heeled dress shoe to be. I'll probably spend a lot of time sitting down while wearing this shoe, so comfort doesn't matter very much. Still, a more comfortable design would have earned this shoe 5 stars instead of 4.
amazon	J. H. Smith	2016-09-13T18:14:52Z	1	I have been an Amazon Prime member for three years and an amazon.com customer since the company began. The only thing good thing I can say is that shopping at Amazon.com is convenient. The price for being a prime customer goes up every year. All of Amazons prices are steadily increasing. The quality of the merchandise is getting worse and worse every year and Amazon Customer Service is the worst in the industry. I will not continue to be a Prime Member after this year's subscription runs out. I now go out of my way to not buy from amazon. Jet.com is a great alternative with cheaper prices and better customer service.Update: As stated above. I ended my relationship with amazon. My experience is that I am saving time, money and frustration by buying from someone else. I mostly shop with Jet.com now. Amazons method of dealing with poor products is to erase the product review so that no one can read about the quality and customer service issues. I even got an email from amazon customer Service saying that they had erased ALL my product reviews because some were negative. My response is that I will pay MORE to shop with another company other than Amazon.  So lets see you erase this review Amazon...
amazon	Justine	2016-09-13T15:09:24Z	4	I have joined the prime service as it saves me money over the year, I did have one delivery not here for 3 days but overall it has been good.
amazon	dave collins	2016-09-13T09:58:33Z	5	"My wife persuaded me to take Amazon Prime after a trial as she was into a series (the technique is called Puppy Dogs )Suddenly I was able to turn a wish like ""I could really do with some new headphones"" or ""I could do with a small portable guitar effects box"" into ""Its in my hands the next day"".I've bought some duds. Next day delivered, tried it, didn't like it and process a refund from the web. Print the label, take it to Royal Mail and days later you get a refund.Twice they failed ""Next Day"". Twice I called their support team with a mild complaint. Twice they added one month to my Prime membership as compensation.Sometimes you pay a little more for the same product under Prime but not much. Its worth it to have the service behind it.What's not to like?"
amazon	Liiz Harris	2016-09-12T18:24:25Z	5	This was the first company I found online on my first windows pc in 95. It just sold books back then, but I was so impressed that I found it !  At that time we had  'dreadful' dial up times but  I've followed it ever since. Amazon has gone from strength to strength and have NEVER failed me. I do most of my shopping there now, Well done Amazon and thank you.
amazon	mary	2016-09-11T03:13:52Z	4	Prime pantry has a great selection and good prices. thankful for the options of movies and tv streaming.
amazon	Sarah	2016-09-10T20:51:43Z	2	"Amazon used to be an incredible company for the people. Now, their ""free shipping"" went from $25 to $49 and only on select items. Their shipping speed is also horrendously slow. They've turned on the consumer, which is heartbreaking because they were a company I've trusted for over 9 years. Returning an item has also become increasingly difficult and costly. I've started using other websites and have been just as pleased as I was when Amazon was in it's original glory."
amazon	Thor	2016-09-07T11:49:30Z	5	No issues with ordering from Amazon.A really big wide of different products and great prices.Amazing fast shipping as well.I recommend buying from Amazon.

amazon	Miketyson226	2016-09-06T23:51:12Z	4	Good experience. Item arrived fast also.
amazon	Giles	2016-09-06T11:03:16Z	1	I ordered a heavy item that was faulty. I tried to return it but the Amazon system requires it posted but will only offer £4.75 return postage cost when the Post Office cost is £19.00.I called the Amazon call centre twice but on both occasions the operators English was so bad they could not understand how to spell my name to access my account details ! Andrews is a fairly easy name to spell?
amazon	Ramy Alfred	2016-09-05T20:14:31Z	5	I would give you guys 10 stars if I could! The most responsive and understanding costumer service I have ever dealt with! They do anything even if it's not really required in order to make you a happy costumer! Will definitely keep using Amazon for everything!
amazon	Eli	2016-09-02T03:53:26Z	5	Its the best eCommerce business. I get to find items for half the cost and get to see other reviews before purchasing the item.
amazon	Daryl	2016-09-01T02:50:37Z	2	I ordered something at what I thought was a good price.   After two weeks and no communication, the seller cancelled, leaving me high and dry.  Furthermore, there was no possible way to even leave feedback about this negative transaction.   I've had other transactions which I have had to dispute as well, costing much time.  While Amazon always has pulled through when I have disputed orders, my overall impression is going downhill.   Plus, it really annoys me that I cannot leave feedback on a transaction which failed, which tells me that no one else can either.    Amazon is no longer my first choice.
amazon	Silvia	2016-08-31T20:36:36Z	5	"As usual Amazon does not disappoint. I have ordered two books with  two different orders. They came both earlier than expected and in perfect shape. If I may, I can say that the only ""minus"" is that the website is so easy and customs friendly that it is difficult to resist ... the buying experience is easy which makes it quite addictive. My comment concerns only my experience as a purchaser, not all the issues that some other customers have raised such as the way in which employees are treated or, I may add, well known tax issues and state aid.As a customer so far I have been fully satisfied."
amazon	Marc	2016-08-29T16:03:58Z	1	The way a company treats its employees should be factored into the buying decisions we make. The BBC Panorama documentary (and other YouTube videos) expose the inhumane working conditions at Amazon distribution centers. These modern day high tech sweatshops dehumanize workers and supervisors alike and  undoubtedly lead to physical and psychological damage.  It is high time for our governments to act before  there is a tragedy that will be compared to the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which claimed the lives of 146 young workers and paved the way for 20th Century labor reforms.
amazon	~Amy~	2016-08-28T07:38:31Z	5	It is so quick and easy to order anything you can think of on Amazon. With Amazon Prime,  I get quick, free shipping on most items.  I also get Amazon Prime on my TV, no more need for expensive cable bills!  Watch great shows free through Amazon Prime!
amazon	Billy Barton	2016-08-26T18:03:53Z	4	The best thing about Amazon is that they basically have everything. I was even able to save us 50%+ on oxygen sensors for our family vehicle and for back to school shopping my wife was able to save almost 75% on school supplies. The only bad thing about Amazon is the reviews section is hard to navigate and filled with mostly unhelpful reviews by people that apparently just want to complain. I've found it helpful to take the review section at basically half value.
amazon	Brian M	2016-08-26T11:45:02Z	5	What can you say about Amazon. Their business model is incredible and they treat their customers great. If you have a problem with an item you just return it, using one of the local drop boxes, and your money is refunded very quickly. I can't say one bad thing about the company. I have been a Prime member for a year now and will extend it another year for sure. You get so much for that yearly price that it pays for itself.
amazon	Kimberly Shaw	2016-08-25T01:02:49Z	5	Great prices, shipping was priced reasonable and delivery was before time.
amazon	WolfgangM	2016-08-22T05:41:08Z	5	A life without Amazon is possible, but pointless :)A dream for any shopping queen. Fast delivery and a huge range of products. One of the best online shops!
amazon	Martha .	2016-08-19T04:16:53Z	5	Love dealing with Amazon they are great. Love being a prime member. The best part is how fast everything is shipped to me and all ways on time with receiving the product. I know they have a Warehouse i think Seattle and in Ca the best part i live in Napa Ca in between both warehouses. Excellent in everything. You can call or email them to response is fast back to you. Very best. My Amazon. and reviews are what i go by to order all so still Great Company.
amazon	Matt Nia	2016-08-18T07:52:48Z	4	I been a customer for 10 years and they continue to do the right thing every time. Recently, I bought a heavy scooter for my son and he could not use it. They took it back without questions asked. Amazing service.
amazon	Marica Fellows	2016-08-17T11:25:29Z	4	I love their free 2 day shipping. It keeps me hooked to this website. The ordering process is pretty easy.What I don't like is that their prices are a bit higher compared to the prices their competitors are displaying.
amazon	D Le Tendre	2016-08-16T06:07:11Z	5	I have a been a Prime member since Amazon first started it. I usually end up buying anything outside of food via Amazon, Prime makes it super easy and fast.
amazon	John Jacob	2016-08-15T19:32:43Z	5	I have been using amazon since high school and have NEVER had an issue with the items I have ordered that are taken care of by amazon.  The one time I did have an issue was when the item was from an overseas vendor and it was handled quickly and only a week late (coming from china that's not bad)
amazon	Pernille	2016-08-14T19:11:16Z	1	After one year of using my Kindle Paperwhite, it stopped working. I tried all the advices from the webpage unsuccesfully. Then I called Amazon. The first person there promised me to return the cost of the Kindle. I should just call back with my Visa card information. When I called back, I was sent to a number of new persons, and every time I had to explain the problem all over. They promised to call back, wich they never did. Now, my account is closed, and my Kindle still doesn't work. Don't buy your things at Amazon.
amazon	Rainie Williams	2016-08-13T17:08:30Z	5	Amazons customer service proves that a company can put the customers satisfaction first ~~~Every time I have an issue on anything they ALWAYS, ALWAYS , REsolve it TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY & go beyond the call of duty to help resolve my issues.... !!!!!   😊😊
amazon	Larry Landis	2016-08-12T05:04:26Z	5	Amazon prime made me so spoiled, but I love it
amazon	Javier	2016-08-11T01:10:46Z	4	its a great place to buy, just be carefull choosing the seller.
amazon	Nansy	2016-08-10T15:59:14Z	1	Bought some of the Devacurl and Goldwell items from them, Different sellers. Got my products shipped to promptly, but unfortunatley the products were in the wors shape ever. Both products looked like there were thrown and dragged on the floor for months. scratches, dents, cracked tops. Talked to the sellers, they gave me the refunds for the orders, but they also informed that amazon does not handle their products well. That they also get a a lot of damaged product from amazon. So if you care if how the products looks and the condition that i comes in, DONT shop on amazon.
amazon	lsegal	2016-08-08T04:43:44Z	5	What is not to like. Good or excellent prices, wonderful selection,very helpful product reviews, easy access of all aspects of youraccount, fast shipping, easy returns. WOW. No other store thatI would say this about.
amazon	Jessica Crawford	2016-08-07T14:42:12Z	4	Never any issues service wise, just don't really like that Prime has been pushing up prices for non-prime customers. And then they also claim that Prime 2-Day Shipping is Free, when I'm paying $100 a year for it. Minor complaints though.
amazon	Deandra	2016-08-06T19:36:30Z	5	I love ordering from Amazon and have been doing so very conveniently for years. They really know how to operate an ecommerce business and keep their customers coming back. I have always received every order very quickly and with no issues. One time I made an order where I did have to make a return because I didn't like the product and didn't think it worked as advertised, and Amazon's return policy was hassle-free for me.
amazon	Rebecca	2016-08-05T20:07:02Z	5	I have had so many good experiences with Amazon. Every single time I've had an issue they have resolved it immediately, with one phone call. They really know how to treat customers so that they want to come back. Each item I received from them was in good condition upon arrival. At the same time the only gripe I have is the packaging. Sometimes it seems like too much, but then again my items are always in one piece.
amazon	Joel	2016-08-05T17:46:17Z	5	best place to find your items.
amazon	Felicia Reed	2016-08-04T13:58:42Z	5	I can always find things on amazon for the best prices that I can't find anywhere else. I have searched for hours on amazon and found thing that I had gave up on finding. It is great!!!!!!!!!!!!
amazon	Sherraine Thomas Grèce	2016-08-03T10:54:40Z	4	I use Amazon ALL THE TIME. I would give them an 8 out of 10.  Some items arrive and it's the wrong item or something missing out of box. Overall I like Amazon and I would order again. My suggestion is for them to check throughly what is going in boxes.
amazon	0006	2016-08-01T01:44:27Z	1	I've been seller at Amazon for few years.Recently I decided to close my Amazon seller account so I contacted to Amazon seller support.  They helped me do this do that to process from my request and Amazon will refund around $200.00 for my seller fee because any of my item has been sold during few month while they charged seller fees. I really appreciated this professional support to Amazon. Next day, I received email from one of Amazon Support and they iniiated to deposit this refund amount to my company's checking account so I can receive the money within 2~3days but I didn't received any money even after 2weeks.  I emailed couple to Amazon couple times and only they sent me automatic reply email.Finally I called Amazon customer support to ask what is going on my refund.  They said the can't find my seller account. They closed my seller account forever.  I tried to log in my account and they permanently removed my seller account.  Customer Support said I can't make any seller account for life once I closed account.  Is this company communist?i tried to contact to Amazon few time more but i gave up.  I've been more than 10 years as a quantity order customer but I can't trust this company any more.  I deleted all my email from Amazon and even no shopping at Amazon probably for whole my life!
amazon	Samantha White	2016-07-31T13:23:55Z	5	I have purchased multiple items from Amazon. It's always great to buy from here.

amazon	Shefali Sachdev Ryan	2016-07-30T02:24:35Z	1	Was sold an old phone by the one of their vendors. I had paid for a new phone but a refurbished model was sent instead. Unfortunately i found this out two months after purchase when i took it to get screen repaired. Despite several communication with amazon they and the supplier kept saying warranty period is over and refused to focus on the point that they committed fraud. Really disappointed as i have been a fan of amazon for years and trusted its service standards and integrity .
amazon	Charlie Chan	2016-07-28T06:20:24Z	5	I've made purchases, reviews, and calls and amazon has never failed me ( as of yet ) in anyway, most manufacturers that go through amazon don't fail me either, I usually do purcashes of electronics and accessories for phones and devices and there's 3 manufacturers that I know have never failed me. Anker, Hyperion, and ZeroLemon are great not just because of the products, but their customer services as well, these manufacturers actually reach out to you ( If you leave reviews good or bad ) and give you the help you need, heck they'll even give you things for leaving honest reviews like coupons and such. I'd recommend Amazon to people who are shopping for accessories for electronics, devices, phones, et cetera.
amazon	Ernie Lee	2016-07-27T21:30:51Z	4	Amazon is NOT Perfect. I have some problem with them. However, I have purchased some products from some other internet shopping mall and learned that Amazon service is actually great. Good feedback, review, and etc. One negative part is the product price. Amazon price seems a bit higher than other internet mall. However, its service is worthy that much.
amazon	Melinda	2016-07-26T20:54:29Z	5	IfI buy online line it is from Amazon. I have never been disappointed in their service.The company always stands behind their products and the shipping is awesome fast . thank you
amazon	Mr Jake Gann	2016-07-26T19:46:59Z	1	Since signing up to Prime, I have had nothing but problems. I really like the idea of next day delivery as I can order an items based on knowing I am around the following day to receive it. I am now on my 4th or 5th delivery where I have had a message to say they tried to deliver but did not!When I tried to cancel the Prime service and get a refund as they have failed to deliver next day since taking service I was told I could not get a refund!If you think Prime is worth £79 for TV services and the next day delivery is a bonus great, but don't do it for delivery reasons - STAY AWAY.
amazon	M. Bentley	2016-07-26T02:03:45Z	2	"We all know what Amazon does: An incredible breadth of products, great prices, and free or cheap delivery. I've been a customer for 18 years, and a prime customer for a few years.No longer. In early 2016, they switched from using actual delivery services, such as USPS, FedEx or UPS, to their own, farmed-out service, ""Amazon Logistics."" Make no mistake, Amazon Logistics is not part of Amazon. It consists entirely of Uber-like drivers in your local area. If you have a white Ford Econoline van, you can be ""Amazon Logistics"" tomorrow. And if you can hire a couple of homeless guys to drive the vans, you can actually make some money.Unfortunately, you get what you paid for. These homeless drivers can't find addresses, don't know how to navigate streets, and sure as heck aren't bonded, so gated communities, condos, apartment complexes, etc, are not going to give them keys -- in stark contrast to UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc. My previous ~800 purchases delivered via those big three were all perfect, except for one. My 12 or so deliveries since they switched to Amazon Logistics have been 0-12. Customer service is useless. Yes, I've been credited for all of the botched deliveries. But it's confusing as to why a company that is so focused on customer service, and renowned for its efficiency, would all of a sudden entrust the final mile of the process to... anyone. Literally, anyone; no background check, no bonding, no verification of insurance, anything. I cancelled my Prime membership as a result, and got the canned ""sorry to see you go,"" email.Amazon's own discussion forum has over 1,000 complaints about Amazon Logistics, and form my research, not a single positive post. Yet Amazon seems to be willing to let those thousands (and many, many more who don't post) wander away, in order to save a few pennies. So be it."
amazon	Jack	2016-07-25T14:59:01Z	4	Anyone who has ever been buying online knows how risky it is to shop at unknown locations. That's why so many people choose amazon - a trusted brand, with great customer protection and overal client-centered approach.The only drawback I see is when I shop for new things only. too many times I find amazon.com in search results only to go to the site and see there's not even one new product (everything used).
amazon	Patrick Baldwin	2016-07-23T15:41:05Z	1	"I have a delivery that they failed to deliver to my home.  This is the Amazon delivery service.  I contacted Amazon.  After a lengthy conversation they said they would deliver it that night.  Right after I got off of chat the first time I got a email asking how I would like the package delivered after spending 15 min in chat telling customer service this exact information.  I then went back to speak to a supervisor and got these responses. ""You are now connected to Yogesh Siddheshwar from Amazon.comMe: You are now connected to Priya from Amazon.comMe: Get me to a supervisor.Priya: Hello, my name is Priya. I'm here to help you today. Thank you for being a Prime member. How are you doing Multi ?Me: Get me to a supervisor.Priya: Please let me know the issue so that I can transfer it to a supervisor.Me: The next thing you should time is please hold a moment while I get you a supervisor.Priya: Please let me know the issue so that I can transfer it to a supervisor. Without knowing the issue I cannot transfer this chat.Me: This is real simple Transfer me to a supervisor as clearly today the first level support is unable to follow simple directions and follow though.Priya: I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.Me: Get me to a supervisor.Get me to a supervisor now or I will post the above chat onling.online*Yogesh Siddheshwar: Hello, my name is Yogesh., I'm here to help you today.Me: Get me to a supervisor.You there?This is very simple you need to answer me and let me know you are getting a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: According to our policy, you will have to tell us your issue first.Me: the first level support is unable to follow simple directions and follow though.That is the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Without knowing the issue we cannot transfer you to our supervisor.Me: Now that you know please transfer me.this is not a hard or complicated request. I already spent 15 min talking to someone just before the above chat that then screwed up.So it is simple give me to your supervisor now.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Yes you can.I have told you the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Is there anything else that I can help you with?Me: Yes you can transfer me to a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Except that?Me: I am not asking for something that is crazy or out of the ordinary.Give me a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Give me to your supervisor. You can do this unless there is no supervisor there and I do not believe that to be the case for one moment.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Give me to your supervisor. You can do this unless there is no supervisor there and I do not believe that to be the case for one moment.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Unless there is a different issue I can help you with, I will be ending this chat.Me: You need to help with the request as it is not unreasonable and I told you the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar from Amazon.com has left the conversation.""After the third chat I final got a supervisor.   She said that the package would be at my home last night.   When it was not I contacted Amazon this morning and after waiting almost 20 min online to speak to a supervisor they transferred me to another rep and not a supervisor.  He then told me that I may have to wait until tomorrow to get my packages that were supposed to be delivered yesterday.  The sad thing is that this is not the first time that I have had this issue with amazon but the fourth. I never have this issue when they use fedex or UPS or USPS just the Amazon delivery service.Update: They just ended another chat on me Me: Are you refusing to transfer me to your supervisor?This is a simple yes or no question. Are you refusing to transfer me to your supervisor.Omkar: I'm sorry, but if there was a way I'd have loved, but there is no way to extend by 6 months.However, I'll do my best to get this order to you. :)Me: Again not the answer to my question.Omkar: I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.Omkar from Amazon.com has left the conversation."

Now I didn't use amazon again this time, but ordered from NEWEGG and I am having a horrible experience.  NewEgg is lying about my order process, been hung up on 3 times, been lied to twice, my new GPU has been in the ""packing"" stage for 5 days now.  This kind of behavior is unacceptable and this kind of behavior is not what Amazon does.  Amazon is the best!  Screw NewEgg!"
amazon	Stef	2016-07-12T12:08:55Z	4	I buy everything from here, and have been a satisfied customer for a long time. However, they have repeatedly raised the minimum purchase price for free shipping over the years. Other changes are also irritating, but overall I am happy with the experience. Buyer beware if you choose a seller from China; item may be cheaper, but you get what you pay for, and may arrive broken in shipment.

amazon	Thomas Warren	2016-07-12T05:19:44Z	3	It has become my go to place for all my shopping. I really am un-happy about the new tracking/targeting system. I feel that they are now charging me more for idem's that I may want. So I am now more careful about what I buy there and shop around more. I use to be a faithful Amazon shopper. Just a bad management decision. Amazon has lost 40% of my business because of this. But they have lots of money... :)
amazon	Mihalis G. A. Papadopoulos	2016-07-07T23:03:12Z	1	"I am a Prime Amazon Member. I ordered a new $1300.00 TV that I found on Amazon which was promised to be delivered ""next day"" on July 6, 2016. The date was updated to July 7, 2016 online when I checked the status online. I called and was told that it would definitely be delivered on July 7th and that Amazon would refund my next day shipping. I waited all day on July 7th for the TV. The TV never arrived. I went online and it said that it was coming by MAIL and that it was in transit! I called Amazon and asked how in the world could they guarantee ANYTHING sent by MAIL to be delivered the following day...and how could they send something so expensive and fragile BY MAIL? They had no answer. The agent put me on hold and said that she would call the USPS about the delivery. She came back online and said that she had spoken with the USPS and had been told it would be delivered by 3:00 p.m. She told me that she would call me back at 4:00 p.m. to confirm the delivery. At 4:20 p.m., I had no TV and no call from Amazon. So, I called Amazon. All the agent could tell me was that, in checking his tracking information, he could see the TV was ""in transit."" I told him that I KNEW that much as I could see it when I looked myself. He told me at that point that the TV would ""probably come tomorrow or the next day."" I told him that I had reserved a man to come out to mount my TV based upon Amazon's ""guarantee"" and all he could say was, ""I'm sorry. I know you are frustrated."" At that point I told him to cancel the order and I would go to Best Buy and get the TV there for the same price. He told me that he canceled the order. I also told him to cancel my Prime Membership as well. I am done with Amazon and their delivery ""guarantee"" days which, obviously, mean nothing at all."
amazon	Ronald Deeds	2016-07-05T23:33:42Z	5	I like the amazon prime service, I couple it with Hulu, and Netflix to entirely wean myself from cable. In addition I save tons of mullah with the free shipping aspect. The only thing I don't like is that they don't compete with groceries cost wise.

Their latest scam is to make you subscribe to Hulu as well so you are paying for both. Be VERY mindful before watching any TV series unless you are going to watch them back to back for days on end, which would be very sad!!!!

amazon	Ed	2016-06-17T07:36:25Z	4	You can get all the products you want at amazon and their trade in program is great as where other companies try to find reasons to downgrade your items they actually upgraded your trade ins when it's justified.  The prime video service is great for the exclusive shows, prime music is lacking in terms of catalog and ease of access.Only negative thing in terms of Amazon is if you are a casual shopper and want to spend $20 here and there you need to get the prime service otherwise you are going to be incurring shipping cost with slower speeds and none of the extra benefits of prime
amazon	tbb	2016-06-15T23:59:35Z	3	I haven't been very happy with the Amazon Prime Service for a while now.   I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about service I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding delivery.  Normally their shipping and delivery estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.

amazon	sean	2016-06-11T07:27:09Z	1	After buying tablet through Amazon from a firm called dracotek it was absolutely rubbish. Wouldn't charge after 6 months. Got in touch with Draco they said send it back to China; which I did. Got a replacement which was just as bad. Told send that one back and both postage be refunded. Draco ignored emails got in touch with Amazon all got off them after 30 days they cant do anything. Who gives 30 day guarantee. Disgraceful easy way to say its your problem. As Draco is in china not a lot I can do. It was an Xmas present for a 9 year old in the end got him one from proper electrical store which we.ve had no problems with.I still shop with Amazon but never buy electrical goods and if buying something make sure its in England. Any problems Amazon will leave you high and dry.

Items arrived damaged, items were not delivered or where delayed.  In every instance Amazon went above and beyond expectations to make it right.  Even if the issue was not directly their fault as was the case where the Postal Service screwed up.
amazon	Emad	2016-06-07T23:48:01Z	1	Amazon try their best to force you to get prime. They delay processing and shipping your items and they think by doing that they will force you to become a prime member. Wrong, I will go and buy my stuff from another retailer and you will lose my business.

amazon	Jane R Elliott	2016-06-05T21:00:28Z	3	Still OK, but I signed on because it was much better with very little out-sourcing and  own shipping NOT USPS!!!

If you have to deal with the out sourced providers it can be a disaster...Communiation with the providers is sometimes very difficult.....
amazon	Evelyn	2016-06-03T03:34:41Z	4	60% stuff in my daily life were bought online. Amazon is always my first choice website. I can find almost everything from it, and its service and product quality is guaranteed and trustable.
amazon	Angela	2016-06-03T03:03:35Z	3	Have been a Amazon Prime member for 2 years. It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the delivery trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get products replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students. I still love Amazon Products but don't know if they are worth the shipping hassle. Questioning Prime Membership. (Netflix for Movies  is better)
amazon	Mohamed	2016-06-02T06:34:58Z	5	Amazon is amazing and suitable for all members of your family and you can find almost everything you want. The only thing is that you have to be careful with sizes, because sizes may be different than your expectation and I recommend that you buy item that can be used generally and do not need to be exactly fit. .
amazon	John	2016-06-01T15:39:09Z	5	Always a good experience.
amazon	Customer - Richard- Ocala, FL	2016-05-30T01:59:21Z	5	"5/29/16  My wife & I recently signed up for Amazon Prime.  We use it on a daily basis. Amazon makes shopping a pleasure. You don't have to go thru the hassle of getting dressed, driving to the store, finding a parking place & dealing with sales people (most of whom are on a commission so they worry you to death by being pushy, insistent & aggressive to make a sale & earn $$$). You have to find a dressing room, undress to try on clothing (when the dressing room is usually a mess from prior custormers use), get dressed and go to checkout where the sales person will try to get you to sign up for the store' card (when you already have Visa or Mastercard, etc). Then you have to trek back to your car and deal with traffic going home,  Amazon eliminates all the above aggravation (you can sit in your ""PJ's) drink your coffee, eat your snack and browse at any hour day or night, compare all your items of interest, make a decison, pay with your card, then click to complete the purchase. With Prime you get free shipping in 2-days. Usually the prices on Amazon are very competitive (usually lower than in the stores).  Amazon Prime certain is 5-starRichard - Ocala, FL 5/29/16"
amazon	Gary Dear	2016-05-29T22:20:52Z	4	Brilliant service and delivery, with exceptional service especially if there is a problem with things I buy off them Highly recommendedWith best regardsGary
amazon	Sabine Johns	2016-05-29T16:15:45Z	5	Magnificent service, I am always thrilled, about the great customer service.
amazon	Nana	2016-05-29T16:07:09Z	5	"It is really easy to sale and purchase from Amazon and their Kindle is really sturdy and affordable for those who just love web browsing and online movie watching.  They even provide many different language options to your Kindle.  I just wish that they would reach out to obtain more apps that the google playstore has.  Like ""Line,"" ""Uber"" and etc.  I do draw internet from my cellphone plans when I'm out.  Also they could enhance their appstore by allowing titles of the apps to be in different languages.  When I'm researching for bilingual games for my son.  It is amazing what I have to guess through the English titles to find them.  And thank you for adding that button to close all apps.  My son was burning down those Kindles way too fast when he runs through the apps w/o closing them and causing them to frequently crash.  Our family are on our 6th Kindle and so far it's great.  Tech support are courteous w/ a bit of accent, but gets what I need done.  Thanks."
amazon	Knud Clausen	2016-05-26T15:51:07Z	2	I use amazon.com 3-4 times a year, mainly to buy books. Last month I suddenly found my credit card charged with USD 99.-, which was supposed to cover one year's membership og Amazon Prime. I have never wanted this membership or knowingly accepted it.I have with some effort been able to cancel it and they have promised to refund me the full amount which I now await. Amazon.com does not clearly show that there is a charge after the trial period.Be careful where you click if you shop on amazon.com or choose another webshop.
amazon	Geoffrey McNeal	2016-05-24T19:46:14Z	4	Well guys I want to say thanks to all Amazon workers, support, to everybody. If you want to get the best quality of customer service- you just have to open up Amazon.com! You are just the best online store ever. I’ve bought Books, clothes, games and laptop. Everything is great and delivered on time.
amazon	Bill	2016-05-24T17:53:18Z	5	I’ve used amazon so many times. And I have to admit that the shipping is really excellent and great. I haven’t had any issues with them.  Also, I can say that you can buy literally everything there( except illegal things) Thank you Amazon team!
amazon	Jennifer O'Neal	2016-05-24T17:27:56Z	4	You can buy everything there. I just wanted to buy marble sculpture of Julius Caesar and guess what? Yes, I’ve found it there! The best shipping in the web!
amazon	John Abrams	2016-05-24T16:35:54Z	5	My review is little bit different. I used amazon as a store and it is great. But my review is about their cloud service. I just wanna say that the Amazon is the best in every sphere. They have virtual servers,  virtual, private clouds.
amazon	Denise Brady-Pruett	2016-05-23T17:58:47Z	5	Amazon is #1 in my book. I highly recommend using Amazon for your online shopping needs. I order through them on a continuous basis from as small as a pencil sharpener, clothes, home theatre system, up to car parts and all. I have not once since shopping and ordering through this site ever had any problems or had any issues with any of my orders. They have EVERYTHING and the prices are way cheaper then in the stores and best of all it's shipped right to you. Amazon is my favorite place to shop and I don't have to go to a ton of different stores it's all in one spot at my fingertips then delivered to my door within 3-5 days max. I love Amazon and I guarantee you will too. Best site ever!!
amazon	Jerry Barry	2016-05-23T04:11:12Z	5	Seriously, the first place I look when buying stuff online from vitamins to computer equipment.
amazon	Aaric	2016-05-23T03:23:32Z	3	What was needed was a birthday gift to a friend . He wanted a music column . Fortunately on GearBeste was a discount on this musical column .

amazon	Quest	2016-05-21T19:43:24Z	5	I shop for everything online at amazon.com! I can get just about anything and sometimes with free shipping. I highly recommend this amazon.com.
amazon	Juile	2016-05-20T17:14:47Z	5	great company, thanks amazon
amazon	Pedro	2016-05-20T04:12:00Z	1	There is a review here from a seller who actually said, pretty good for a seller - Was that a joke? You gotta be kidding me right? Hey everyone, Amazon policies allows scammers and thieves to steal from sellers on their platform, The golden era is over Amazon, go somewhere else, we don't need you! Latest item I sold on Amazon, an HP computer, Amazon let the buyer keep both, the laptop and the money, What a shame, what a scam artist, the best of all, it is in their policies.
amazon	Eugene Metreveli	2016-05-19T15:46:04Z	5	Used it as a seller for more than a year.
amazon	Danielle	2016-05-19T04:19:06Z	5	Amazon is by far, my absolute favorite online store. They have just about anything you can imagine, apart from illegal items. Any time that I have had an issue with them, they resolve it quickly, and painlessly. I love the wide range of items that the store has to offer, and the prices are usually quite reasonable. Shipping is always timely. A lot of the time I receive my item before it was expected to come. Definitely a store that I buy things from frequently.
amazon	Justin Sheridan	2016-05-18T19:15:14Z	5	Good to know there is a company you can fully trust. I feel that kind of trust with Amazon. Was never let down.
amazon	Tom Gazaway	2016-05-14T18:53:57Z	5	I love Amazon.  With Amazon Prime I get stuff next day.  Really cool.
amazon	Michael Doren	2016-05-14T11:14:01Z	1	Don't buy from :Kitchen Tools & Skills Ltd - Amazon Marketplace I tried to cancel a incorrect order 6 hours later, their response:I'm sorry, I did not see your message earlier due to a problem with our only computer. We now have a new one. Very lame. I bet there order computers were up...!
amazon	Bailey Garcia	2016-05-13T19:28:39Z	5	If you're a student you can get Amazon prime for free for 6 months. After the 6 months you'll like it so much you'll keep the subscription. From textbooks, to supplies you can find anything on here and get it shipped to you in just two days.
amazon	Justin	2016-05-13T16:14:30Z	5	From books, video games, to everyday goods such as paper towels, laundry detergent, and dog food (Subscribe & Save + Prime = awesome!), Amazon is where I do all my shopping.  Amazon Prime, despite the pricey annual membership, is incredibly convenient and quickly pays for itself just for the free 2 day shipping along.  I can't imagine shopping this conveniently anywhere else.
amazon	Petra Muse	2016-05-13T06:07:09Z	5	Every experience has been Positive☺
amazon	Sarah Trett	2016-05-12T16:21:50Z	1	I sell original art online but Amazon are allowing thousand of stolen low res screen grabbed designs to repeatedly be reposted by rogue third party sellers on various low quality items. The flood of cheap counterfeit copies of my pillow designs and that of others is killing many small art businesses. I can no longer continue to design pillows because the designs get stolen. Whilst Amazon do allow infringement reporting it is per item so when you find over 100 stolen, filing my image theft takes most of my day everyday as the images then reappear under different new sellers name a few days later. Buyers beware from third party Amazon stores, look at the seller and keep to trusted longer running stores. Disappointed Amazon are not doing more to protect buyers and close reported rogue sellers down completely. Hope they will take stronger action for everyone's benefit.
amazon	Savvy shopper	2016-05-10T18:54:10Z	4	Goods received as stated but delivered late at night so no 5 star
amazon	Ellen Kidd	2016-05-10T06:50:33Z	2	I ordered 4 dining chairs but owing to the first order not going through properly the figure was 8 chairs ..i cancelled four of them but when cancelling the order amazon continued to hold the authorisation thus preventing me from using those funds in my bank account ,this went on for days with amazon blaming my bank and my bank blaming them the whole experience was v poor .in the end amazon admitted it was a mistake on their behalf .....saying human error ....i wont place big high value orders with them again.took far too long to sort out
amazon	Jenn P	2016-05-09T18:46:48Z	5	Never once had a problem with an Amazon delivery. Pleased with Prime.
amazon	ONALI	2016-05-09T11:58:21Z	1	This is very bad incident about amazon.I book Protein powder from nutrilite and amzon delivery on 13 th march 2016 but even after 31st march, there has no response from amazon.I talked to his customer care executive, he blindly give date over date but as on date none of any item deliver.I booked my shirts as shown in the pictures given in their site but when actual i received and when i show i am shocked what a bad quality of shirts as well as not cotton, its terrycloth.So now i never purchase any item from amazon and I all to say please dont buy any product from amazon.
amazon	Mustafa Hasanovic	2016-05-09T11:36:35Z	5	From Amazon to Denmark 3 days shipping! thats nice and fast i will keep buying stuff on your sitzes!!

amazon	Henrik Pahus	2016-05-06T09:27:57Z	1	"Never, ever use Amazon Payments! Sure it works as a payment form, but when you have trouble getting your money back on a subscription that was already cancelled, Amazon customer service is non-existing. Have spend the last 3 days trying to get help from Amazon customer service, and it is quite clear, that despite numerous mails from their side regarding ""our customer is important"", they have no intention of helping me with a mistake that they made... Very disappointing and the last time that I will use their Payments."
amazon	XZ	2016-05-05T03:13:06Z	5	Amazon has been incredible over my past 6 years of experience with them. As a prime member, they do take my inquiries very seriously. I have lost a few packages and they always assume responsibilities, as well as providing me free extension of my membership when a package is late, and also frequent courtesy credit / free one day delivery when they screw up.
amazon	Giorgos Papadopoulos	2016-05-05T00:47:31Z	4	I have an expert experience as a buyer at Amazon,Ebay,Aliexpress and Banggood and I have to admit that Amazon is much better than every competitive.It's the only one that you can trust 100% about buyer protection.That's the reason that the prices are a little high than the average.
amazon	Michelle Bergeson	2016-05-04T19:00:54Z	5	I turn to Amazon for all my gift giving and hard to find shopping!  They are loyal and easy for refunds.  Thank you AMAZON!!!
amazon	Lemon Crisp	2016-05-03T16:49:55Z	5	I love shopping in Amazon.Their products are great and a lot of choice to choose.
amazon	Alexxus	2016-05-02T13:56:08Z	5	I have had no issues with anything i have bought everything was great quality and exactly as described. i have had one issue before with my bed frame coming in 4 days late but it was a pretty big package coming from quite a bit away from where i live. Overall i love this company and continue to shop here alot. i can always find anything im looking for at a great price and usually free shipping or very cheap shipping. but i always find enough things i want to get free shipping.
amazon	Rocky Galardi	2016-05-01T03:10:34Z	3	Good service but poor customer service when it comes to getting the package and having a problem with the shipping.
amazon	Tobias Valbjørn	2016-04-27T10:37:10Z	5	I don't even need to say more. I have literally bought more than 1000 books from amazon. After they introduced the kindle the number has just gone up. The one-click payment works good, and I love the system, where I can see all the books and just download the ones from my collection that I am currently reading. The prices are just so great for me who lives in Denmark. A book in Denmark costs 60 dollars on average, but a kindle is just around 8, a huge difference. You help me expand my world. Thank you,
amazon	Paul L	2016-04-27T06:53:48Z	1	I purchased a copy of Sage Instant Accounts 2015 on Amazon prime which was in stock at £99.00. On the day I am expecting delivery, Amazon sent an email at 2am in the morning advising they are unable to source the following item and my order has now been cancelled. I recheck Amazon and they have it in stock but the price has been increased to £141.48. I assume the price hike is the reason my order was cancelled.

amazon	Brad Fadden	2016-04-22T01:43:26Z	1	Be careful using Amazon.com.    I just waited 6 hours because their website said that a delivery was out for delivery and will be here by 8 today.  To make a long story short, they said they made a mistake and would like to offer $20 in Amazon dollars to spend.  Total waste of Thursday night and now a Monday night.  They had issues at there end but do not have a process set up to notify customers.  Prime member for a long time, but I will not be ordering from there again.

Also the shipping cost when I send back.WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECT ADVERTISING ALEKO OR AMAZON ?AT LEAST AMAZON HAS TO CHECK AND IS RESPONSIBLE - ITIS MY BUSINESS _ PARTNER AND ON AMAZON INTERNET SITES IS THE WRONG INFORMATION !!!

amazon	nathan	2016-04-18T02:38:37Z	3	"I do buy some items on Amazon, not too many.  Do not buy cosmetics, or anything lower cost that the Chinese can make, as there are thousands of fake items listed on Amazon.com. It is more expensive as well.  I find an item on Amazon, and find the exact seller and same item on EBAY for much less.  I tried to open a store on Amazon, it did not go so well.  Our money was held for a very long time (we did not get paid for months) and what we here this is the norm.  We also listed my Company phone number (expensive items) so customers could call to confirm we were the real deal. Most were asking for our number from Amazon, as customers of high end item want to Many want to talk to a human, not a computer.  Amazon did not like this, gave us a hard time, so we no longer sell on Amazon. Amazon is good for sellers of low cost items that are somewhat standard, easy to spot a consumer, not high end or custom items that consumers want to discuss before a purchase.  While this could happen on Amazon, Amazon's Terms & Conditions make every item a ""Coke"", and if you are not selling a ""Coke"" forget it."
amazon	Erin Janean	2016-04-12T14:14:57Z	5	amazon is a wonder company. I can get clothes that I would normally get imported from amazon. Plus I have prime, so I receive them is two days.
amazon	Richard	2016-04-10T07:23:35Z	5	I've use Amazon for a long time, with no probs. Sent first item back ever and got wonderful customer service. The problem was Royal Mail! Refusing to take parcel.
amazon	Gemma	2016-04-09T09:34:51Z	1	I attempted to purchase something from Amazon and use a virtual Visa card which I was told BY THEM is basically like a credit card and I'd be able to use it! Then things took a ridiculous turn in that the card wouldn't work and in contacting their customer services team I got zero help. It's actually hilarious that in the end they sent me a total of 11 replies without managing to answer my actual query at all. I requested to make a complaint and continued to get conflicting information and random agents trying to tell me they were in charge yet continued to send me conflicting and useless information!I went and spent my money elsewhere in the end ...what a joke! I also ended up cancelling my Amazon unlimited account as there's nothing like shocking customer service to make you not want to give someone your money anymore - they were so unhelpful didn't seem like they wanted it.I have to admit this is the first time I've had an issue with Amazon ...I've been shopping with them for around 13 years, but this episode was pretty catastrophic and went on for about 2 weeks! I never did really get the response I was waiting for and that's why I gave up! I now prefer to use other online stores and eBay although I think Amazon is great for range of products, not interested in being treated like I don't matter as a customer again!
amazon	Vincent Wallin	2016-04-09T08:31:07Z	4	Same item I find the price much higher than ebay or other webstores. Amazon make a lot of money, customers pay for them.
amazon	Skye B.	2016-04-07T07:58:08Z	5	I go to Amazon for pretty much everything and I never have a problem! Fast shipping, easy returns and everything you can think of. Doesn't get better
amazon	Anonymous	2016-04-06T12:34:37Z	2	Amazon used to be a great way to get just about anything quickly for a good price.  Unfortunately, they have become very sloppy about how they pack things.  If you order anything fragile, expect it to arrive damaged.  Amazon customer service is always willing to go out of their way to make things right.  Unfortunately, it's hard to obtain satisfactory replacements since they often arrive damaged as well.  All in all, I can no longer recommend Amazon.  I hope that they will improve in the future as they used to be a great service.
amazon	Anthony Dawson	2016-04-05T18:24:28Z	2	Purchased a Worx lawn mower from Amazon with 3 year guarantee broke just after 2 because of battery they don't reply to emails why do they sell these mowers if you cannot get spare parts.Will they refund my account?
amazon	Bobby Lew	2016-04-01T14:36:56Z	5	I have been using Amazon for many years and have done hundreds of purchases with them. A lot of the times they are cheaper than others like eBay, Home Depot, or even Walmart. While I've still purchased from the others I have many times purchased Amazon over them even when they are more expensive because I know they are a pleasure to deal with from beginning to end without any wasted time on my part even when things go wrong. Sometimes an item doesn't work out or is defective and I don't have to waste much time or effort to make it right with Amazon (no driving and waiting in line or lengthy arbitration process).Thank you Amazon you've grown for a reason.
amazon	Sonja	2016-04-01T11:42:36Z	4	Every product we ordered came after a weeks or so, which is not so bad as its international shipping. I wish intenational delivery was a bit cheaper so we can order monthly suplies of nappies and other baby stuff. But overall, satisfied customer.

amazon	Loretta	2016-03-26T20:41:36Z	5	I have shopped with Amazon for years and cannot think of a single complaint.  There is a huge inventory of various products.  Ordering is easy, and almost all shipments come quickly and in great shape.  On the few occasions that an item might not be in perfect shape, Amazon has rectified the problem immediately and professionally.  Additionally, they are really nice about returns and replacements.  Everyone I talk to on the phone is pleasant and helpful.  I am also now thoroughly enjoying Amazon Prime.
amazon	Oliver O	2016-03-26T19:44:31Z	4	Can't really fault them, aside from the tax dodgyiness.

amazon	James Drew	2016-03-14T15:21:25Z	2	The standard Amazon experience is still great with good customer service.  However, do not use their registry service.  The registry sent my recipient the wrong item, which they had to return (it happens.)  However, they also charged me twice for the item while saying they received the return successfully.  Everything in my Amazon account shows that the return was received and processed successfully.  So I had to contact Amazon to dispute the second charge on my credit card.  However, if you ordered off the registry standard Amazon service cannot help you.  You need to talk to the registry department and they have limited hours.  So I had to call back when the registry department opened.  Eventually I got the issue sorted, but with an underhanded charge to my credit card, and limited support availability this is not the Amazon I have dealt with in the past.
amazon	John	2016-03-13T23:21:41Z	5	Best customer service ever!!!
amazon	H.A	2016-03-08T22:41:59Z	1	Amazon.com is perfect for customers. I do buy on Amazon and they offer good service. Most of third party sellers are great and Amazon its self without the doubt has the best service. However, when it comes to treating sellers they are horrible. They communicate with you as a seller like you are a criminal or a thief. Very rude and unprofessional.  I hope Amazon do something about their seller Central and take care of its sellers.
amazon	Daniele Mendes Herrera	2016-03-08T22:05:57Z	2	The Amazon prime was great in the begin! I used to get in the real two days. Now is may be two, tree four. It depend. I used to buy a lot from Amazon! the service now is worse than Walmart!
amazon	Lucinda	2016-03-08T13:45:05Z	5	I love Amazon and order from them regularly.  I love being able to shop from home and still get a great guaranteed product.  We shop Amazon for everything from K-cup coffee to clothing and electronics.  Haven't had a problem yet!
amazon	Geoff Wanaka	2016-03-07T17:56:17Z	5	I use Amazon a LOT and always find what I'm looking for at great prices! I love the subscribe and save option too, use that a lot. Will keep shopping here for a long time
amazon	Tim Butler	2016-03-04T15:34:03Z	5	if only more websites could be like this. so easy to use plus next day delivery. why shop anywhere else?
amazon	james holdsworth	2016-03-04T12:36:23Z	5	Literally Amazing
amazon	Jack Brumley	2016-03-01T19:48:30Z	5	I have shopped on Amazon for 2 years. Always good experience. The only thing I would recommend, is, as soon as I order something, charge me then. Don't wait until it ships.
amazon	Vinoth	2016-02-28T02:34:49Z	5	Great company and i love it very much.

amazon	Alpha Seeker	2016-02-27T19:26:02Z	1	Navigating this website is like trying to get out of the matrix.  Blue pill please
amazon	Patrick Dolan	2016-02-22T17:12:26Z	1	I bought an Abus lock holder for my bicycle on Amazon. The seller stated it would fit an Abus 53 lock, which is what mine is, but it does not.I wrote a review on Amazon to warn other Amazon customers about this but Amazon refused three times to allow me to post this polite review.It also looks like I will never get my money back from either the seller or Amazon.My advice to anyone reading this is to try your best to buy the items you need from the High Street first.This way if you have any problems you, 1) don't incur postage returns cost, 2) your local high street store will be more than happy to refund it and 3) will allow you to leave a honest review on the matter on their website. Whereas Amazon can do none of the above three, or will only do it if and when it suits their needs. So think very carefully before you decide to buy anything online, especially from Amazon.
amazon	James	2016-02-20T02:39:25Z	5	A pleasure buying from Amazon as always!  As a Prime member, there have been days where I ordered something in the morning and had it by nightfall (and without the upgraded shipping).
amazon	Samuel Methusalek	2016-02-19T22:44:04Z	4	Who doesnt love Prime? SO many secret perks, streaming music, streaming movies, free shipping, special deals and on and on. Love it!
amazon	DeeJay84	2016-02-19T16:29:45Z	3	Sometimes there are a few problems with Amazon.But that's ok.Shipping is really slow sometimes but payment is easy.
amazon	JannisLav	2016-02-19T16:21:53Z	5	Everytime fast shipping and good service.
amazon	AKI	2016-02-19T15:18:46Z	5	The title says it all. Never had a problem with Amazon and with their prices and fast shipping I built myself a complete desktop.

amazon	Massimo Roncati	2016-02-19T14:27:37Z	5	Good services in this site
amazon	hydrogen	2016-02-17T18:20:29Z	4	It's a good site to buy products.I never had any problems with them.
amazon	T. Beck	2016-02-17T17:04:29Z	4	I like Amazon and have had a good time with them. There have been very few issues and I always get my products. A few late deliveries and minor issues but overall they are pretty good.
amazon	m.byars	2016-02-15T20:28:07Z	1	I loved Amazon when they came out. Everything was easy, everything was fast. Reminded me of Newegg, but for everything.Then Prime happened... then Prime REALLY happened.I never used Prime, I got everything in 2-3 days anyway. Sometimes freakishly fast. Why get it? After Prime being out for awhile I started to notice that it took me the recommended time to get my packages... 5-8 (business) days. So I started watching the tracking more carefully only to learn, they would WAIT to ship my item so I got it in the recommended time, instead of just shipping it out like they used to.I justified Prime to myself as a smart way to not only enjoy (a guaranteed) 2 day shipping feature, but it made sense if I replaced Netflix with it. Let me just tell you Amazon Prime Video is nothing compared to Netflix. The mobile app is horrid too. I actually had to do research to learn how to get it on my phone, and then it was just poor. I don't even use it, think i removed it actually because Amazon was using the Prime Video app as delivery service for notification adds and other crap I didn't want.Now what really drove me to write this review. About 2 weeks ago I order a product, its about 6pm at night, I realize in like 15 minutes, I don't need it, I found what I thought I lost. I cancel within 30 minutes of ordering, it confirms it on screen, tells me I will receive an email shortly when the system updates it. Next morning I check my mail, my item has been packaged and shipped... in like 16 hours my item was never canceled, put in a box, and shipped out? I had to pay to return it by the way.Friday I order some more stuff, all Prime items. I get something Sunday (I was like OK Amazon, I see you). Today I check the mail for the main item... not there. I look in my Amazon account to make sure the item was Prime... it is, but I won't get it until Thursday.Amazon built something awesome, now they are coat tailing that reputation. In my personal experience, they have become money hungry, want to be in everything and are getting worse at what made them great. They try to rope you in to Prime so bad, even take away what used to be a great, fast buying experience to do so, and they whole Prime product its self is just smoke.Definitely canceling my Prime, plus Amazon isn't even as competitive with their pricing as they once were, I can online shop and check eBay and beat Amazon more than half the time now a days anyway and eBay (and many others) won't charge me yearly to make sure my item get shipped that or the next day.
amazon	Эд Остин	2016-02-14T17:39:48Z	5	Groceries came slightly damaged,Amazon sent me a complete replacement immediately and told me to do what I wished with the damaged item!Great service,
amazon	Tammy Buck	2016-02-12T03:08:35Z	5	We order everything from Amazon!  Food, clothing, toys...you name it.  Amazon is our go to place for eveything.   Love the competetive prices, free shipping, and easy returns.
amazon	SC	2016-02-11T22:34:59Z	4	I am very happy with Amazon. I have purchased 2 bikes from them and had them shipped to another state. They both arrived perfectly.I have ordered several gifts and had no issues with quality or delivery dates.My one big issue with a defective gift was taken care of and Amazon followed up on the issue to make sure it was resolved.I will continue to be a frequent purchaser with Amazon.
amazon	margaret	2016-02-08T18:24:17Z	5	sometimes I get my products in just one day even when I don't select one day delivery option at checkout. so that's Amazon.
amazon	Patrick Nails	2016-02-05T11:09:44Z	4	Most of the times I get my stuff on time with Prime. I love that service. Although, Amazon needs to add more things to the Prime Service!
amazon	Richard Maiello	2016-02-05T03:02:04Z	5	I was looking through my Amazon account today, and I realized that I've been a customer for 15 years. Wow, how time flies.In all that time, I can count on the fingers of one hand how many problems I've had -- and every time, they more than made it right. It's refreshing, actually: a high-tech, cutting-edge company with old-fashioned values and customer service.Amazon is one of the very few companies that I unreservedly recommend.
amazon	Richard H.	2016-02-03T22:51:20Z	4	Most sales experience are good. The one time I had an issue where a seller did not deliver, Amazon refunded completely and took care of the problem.
amazon	Michael Walsh	2016-02-03T19:25:05Z	5	I buy a lot of things from Amazon and have never been let down.  Most of the things that I buy come from individual sellers, not from Amazon, but I suppose Amazon keeps them on a tight leash, because they always get me what I order and quickly.
amazon	James B. Fajardo	2016-02-03T08:29:01Z	5	I've been using Amazon for the last 3  years and always hace received my orders on time. Is reliable and fast.

amazon	Jayden Davis	2016-01-30T12:57:39Z	4	The amazon app is more good than the website. There are some confusion for a choosing products in website. But the app is fine for me.
amazon	Isabella Johnson	2016-01-30T09:27:00Z	5	The amazon shopping app is amazing. It's very simple and very useful. It's not complicated than the others.
amazon	Karetha Palmer-Dellgrottaglia	2016-01-29T18:50:07Z	3	I love amazon for their books, their prime, customer service, and their amazing deals. 5 stars pretty much all around. Howver, regarding boots, shoes, and some other goods:While shopping for boots have you ever noticed the same model of the same brand is said to run big on one site, small on another, get 5 stars here, or three stars there? People from one site swear by this brand or this style, others have nothing but complaints? I have been in the re-sale business of shoes for several years now and have noticed several interesting quirks when researching and reselling shoes. The era of 6pm and Amazon have (unfortunately) created loopholes for customers who think they can count on a brand name (even Frye, Keen, Sorel, etc) for quality. 6pm and Amazon frequently (if not always) sell cheaper low quality versions. For example: The boots you buy from the company are all leather with a leather sole and welted construction (sole sewn to the boot) for example, but Amazon's are glued together with rubber soles. Full grain leathers are used on the company's boots, split leathers are used on the others. I don't know why the brand's allow for this blatant misuse of their names and logos (except that it must be profitable), but be aware that what you are buying through these companies will not last and is not the quality you may be expecting.
amazon	Jemima Thatcher	2016-01-29T12:19:41Z	5	Great service, I signed up for prime and the next day delivery is fantastic. Just wish it wasn't quite so convenient to spend all my money!

amazon	Karen Jacobsen	2016-01-28T19:44:56Z	1	More than 1and a half month I ordered some books. I have not received them. Perhaps they are stuck in the customs. But I can not track the deliverance.

amazon	learjock	2016-01-24T13:47:05Z	2	Amazon.it does not indicate on their website that their suppliers are out of country and shipping delays are in weeks instead for days. If one needs a part or item in a hurry, they are screwed. Location/shipping knowledge is not evident until the order is SHIPPED. With a shipping notification an order cannot be cancelled!Amazon.it is not (USA) Amazon.com........ Only the names are similar.

It makes it easy for me to study the questions I have a hard time with. The practice tests have good explanations so I know why I messed up. It’s easy for me to learn and fix my mistakes. I think this is a great guide. I recommend this to anyone who needs practice with the new SAT book!
amazon	Anne Mette	2016-01-10T19:02:10Z	5	UPS failed to deliver as ordered and would not correct their error. Amazon contacted UPS and secured that UPS delivered as ordered. Therefore I got my reader.
amazon	Engin	2016-01-10T00:57:48Z	5	I've been using Amazon for the last 5-6 years and been a Prime member for 4.5 years. I've been ordering pretty much everything from them including small household items, books, a 55-inch TV, baby crib, etc. I wasn't disappointed so far. They are very professional on shipping and disputes. They often deliver early and I can return things easily with no charge. Sometimes when I call them for a dispute, they right away offer a refund without even asking the item back. I had to convince them a couple of times not to fully refund me, because I still keep the item. It sounds ridiculous but that is how they handle disputes :).
amazon	Ivedette joseph	2016-01-09T01:43:46Z	5	I have great relationship with Amazon fast service fast shipping and great prices always.
amazon	M.C.Wright	2016-01-07T00:46:50Z	5	Great service. Received order on time as promised!
amazon	Frank Schmidt	2016-01-04T15:34:48Z	1	I have been ordering from Amazon for a few years.  In the past shipping was always fast no matter what method you used.  Now if you don't use Prime your order sits for 7-10 days.  Even small internet companies ship within a few days.  Just not the company it use to be.  Before I would just go to Amazon now I look at other companies to find what I want and to my surprise the prices are often less then Amazon.
amazon	Kimberley Motes Osteen	2016-01-03T16:31:14Z	3	I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on products on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive experiences with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.
amazon	Jeff	2016-01-03T15:36:19Z	1	I used Amazon for years and was happy, but never really had to call customer service. Then I was double charged for the Amazon Prime membership and figured it would be an open-and-shut case to get the second charge refunded. Not so... they said they would refund (I even got an email saying it) but the refund never showed up so I called back and then they refused, saying the second Prime membership had been used. Had to dispute the transaction with my CC company. I have been having more issues with Amazon as the company has evolved, now it is time to go with Target.
amazon	TEUKU SYAHRANI	2015-12-29T08:18:32Z	5	Awesome company, good sellers + buyers protection from fraud, so far only have great experience for shopping there, too bad i still cant purchase some digital products (other than kindle ebooks) just because of the unnecessary geographical restrictions :{
amazon	Alan	2015-12-28T05:39:21Z	1	The most recent order had a four day delay before being shipped. Five days for the one before it. I have actually cancelled an order after a week of waiting for it to be shipped and purchased it from a local store for less and had it in hand immediately! If I had known they carried it sooner I would have never wasted my time with Amazon. It has reached a point of absurdity. This never happened before Prime was introduced. Now it is blatantly clear that they are attempting to force you to buy prime just to get what is considered basic customer service anywhere else in terms of on time shipping. Granted Prime has other perks, but they are of no value to me. They no longer have a price advantage, no tax savings, and shipping is a joke. I won't be using amazon anymore. Save yourself time and money. It probably costs you less overall, and you'll likely get it faster by choosing to buy from someone else.
amazon	Save	2015-12-27T18:05:44Z	5	Reliable and fast
amazon	Kathryn Glaser	2015-12-25T19:09:27Z	1	I just started with Amazon Prime.  In order to get a quick item to my teenaged nieces and nephews I decided to order gift cards because Amazon promotes their gift cards saying 1 day delivery.  I wanted to give them an item to open so I chose the ones that come in a tin.  I ordered on the 21st.  as of the 24th they were not delivered and then I discover, were not even shipped out until the 23!  I never would have  ordered Amazon gift cards if I thought they may not arrive on time or that they would not ship.  I received no email spoiler alerts, nothing.  The tracking says now they are expected to arrive on the 26th!   Great.   VISA CARDS by mail may have arrived late also, but, my nieces and nephews could use that card anywhere-mall, gas station, restaurant.  I'm never ordering an Amazon gift card again. No value whatsoever, only limited and inconvenient.  I don't trust Amazon's shipping claims either.  I would allow for a week at least, to be safe. If you have to order an Amazon gift card, do it electronically.  At least there is an email record and they can't be lost.
amazon	mirze	2015-12-25T13:28:48Z	5	When ordering from Amazon, I always received the goods in perfect condition. My most recent order was scheduled to arrive between December 30 and January 3 - but it actually arrived on December 24. This is a good service! (Although a better timing at Amazon would enable customers to better plan their purchases and somebody may not order a product if it is scheduled to arrive too late.)
amazon	Frederick Gladstone	2015-12-24T19:08:40Z	1	I tried to order a few Sony digital cameras from Amazon.  Once in my Cart, the system recommended cases for the cameras.  Good idea.  I ordered those, too.  However, the camera order was not fulfilled by the supplier.  Not Amazon's fault, however, Amazon still shipped the camera cases.  I wish they had asked if I still wanted those cases once the camera order was cancelled.  A company like Amazon could have easily found another supplier for the cameras.  They didn't, and told me to just re-order myself.  I originally ordered on Black Friday.  Prices have since gone up.  Amazon said it will not honor original pricing.  I'm now not rewarding Amazon with the re-order of the cameras.  However, I will be returning the camera cases that I now don't need.  Last, I put a negative review on Amazon.  However, they emailed to say they wouldn't put it up because reviews can't contain comments on Amazon customer service, only on products.  How nice.  They know the problem, could make it right, but won't, and now won't post the review because they don't want anyone else to know. Been with Amazon 17 years - even after they allowed my 13 yr old to order Amazon Prime without my knowledge.  May be time to find other online shopping options.
amazon	Kelli	2015-12-23T15:43:15Z	5	There is not a negative thing you could say about amazon customer service, unless you are just a complainer. Anytime I have had an issue, they went above what I expect to make it right. I have never had to make a single phone call to them when there was an issue, I have always been able to resolve it over chat or email. I online shop all the time, and this is by far the safest company you could possibly shop with. Thank you, Amazon!!
amazon	Samantha Jones	2015-12-21T07:31:12Z	2	DONT EXPECT TO MANY IMAGES!!!!!!!!!!!
amazon	Ravi	2015-12-20T00:13:45Z	5	Amazon comes through for me every Christmas! All my orders this year arrived earlier than estimated and everything was perfect - no probs. I would (and have) recommend Amazon!
amazon	james kailor	2015-12-16T01:08:11Z	4	I love amazon, the next compare thing is ebay, but amazon is much better cause only deal with professional sellers. However, I usually to buy a lot of OTC meds, and most sellers do not put the product details of the product. For example, if you buy melatonin but it also contain vitamin B, sellers should show that.
amazon	Aaron Berger	2015-12-15T17:43:49Z	4	Almost always receive my package on time and quickly, its great!

amazon	Karen	2015-12-10T20:14:47Z	1	This company makes it impossible to contact them. And when you do contact them they don't speak English. Buy from them at your peril.
amazon	Katie	2015-12-10T13:05:33Z	1	"I recently had a poor service with Amazon, where I paid for something to be delivered to me express by one of their sellers (so a third party).  The seller did not address the package properly, so instead of arriving express, it took weeks to track it down. They refused to accept any responsibility since the items had eventually arrived.  So I filed a claim through Amazon. I requested a refund on the shipping - or at least to refund the difference between standard and express shipping. Whoever read my complaint didn't read the details properly, and they responded with what was clearly a templated response about an issue not even related to my claim!! I wrote back  and asked them to look at the actual facts of my complaint. I heard nothing.I contacted them via chat - and asked them to look at the facts of my case. The chat person submitted a request and said I'd hear back within 24 hours. 15 days later - still nothing.So I go onto chat again, and this time I get a respose back within 20 minutes from the complaints team. But instead of responding to my issue they say - and I quote ""There will be no further response to your e-mail messages regarding this transaction."" HOW IS THAT SERVICE? They refuse to read the details of my claim. Turn me down and then shut the door in my face?  UNBELIEVABLE AMAZON. Thank goodness there's plenty of alternatives around to buy from these days - because you JUST LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER."
amazon	Coby Soni	2015-12-09T19:50:48Z	5	Not always the cheapest, but excellent customer service, quick delivery and you get what you ordered.  What else can I ask for?

amazon	D Ghosh	2015-12-07T09:22:31Z	5	So far this is the BEST online purchasing site.I loved their way of  customer handling and return as well as refund policy.If there is delay then they inform time to time.Products are also upto the mark...ALL THE BEST and CARRY on.

amazon	John	2015-12-04T11:14:07Z	5	I've never had a problem with them that was never able to be easily fixed. I joined prime because all I order it winds up saving me double the cost of the program.
amazon	Brandon Babcock	2015-12-04T03:58:57Z	3	I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic products for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer service every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.
amazon	PATRICIA OLIVE	2015-12-04T02:13:53Z	5	I ordered 2 pair of support knee high hose because my legs were swelling and my doctor told me to get some support hose to wear and that would probably help my swelling. I called and got a representative to help me figure out what I needed. I can't remember his name but he was so nice and helped me decide what I needed. He helped me from the very beginning and to the end of my order. I couldn't of done it I don't think if he hadn't of helped me. I would order from them any time that I needed any  thing. There knee highs were very nice and they are working very good for me.
amazon	Andrea	2015-12-02T03:59:22Z	3	I buy almost everything through Amazon, it's so convenient when you're a Prime Member. Gotta love them for that!The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer service rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer service who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day.For an e-commerce company that deals with so many products, they did not a very good job at properly packaging the glass items. Very disappointing!
amazon	Tim	2015-12-01T07:18:30Z	5	cant live without this are you kidding? give them a default 5 stars.
amazon	dani	2015-11-20T19:56:08Z	5	From shipping, to defective items, Amazon is a dream. It has everything you want, and I accidentally placed an order and was able to cancel it hassle-free. THIS is what makes a company #1 in its position. Other companies can't seem to understand this, yet are still in business. It blows my mind. But with Amazon, I purchase things with no worries and I know they'll get my items to me. Sometimes they even arrive early, and if there is an issue, they are prompt, proactive and ever-eager to solve the problem. This company is a leader in its space and it's easy to see why. They CARE about their customers as they are the lifeline of their business/company. Bravo, Amazon! I'll be a lifelong customer.As for the reviews section of their site, yeah, a lot of them are fake. But it's not hard to use another site or just google to do more review research. Amazon could do a better job of vetting out bad/fake reviews, though. Still, they deserve, easily, 5 stars.

amazon	bt	2015-11-10T15:52:22Z	1	They limit you to £2.80 postage even when they know the book is heavy.  I just had to pay £12.98 postage and so made no money on my sale - of course Amazon made £5.92.  Very poor service, sell it elsewhere.
amazon	Chris Parker	2015-11-09T20:35:11Z	1	"""Prime"" items are consistently way overpriced. In addition to the $100 a year membership fee, you actually have to pay for their ""free shipping."" on 95% of the items I buy online, I find them for cheaper (including the cost of shipping) from other retailers. Additionally that now have ""Add On Items"" which essentially means you have to make a minimum purchase before you get their ""free"" shipping (which you are still paying for since they inflate the price of their ""Prime"" items). Also you have no choice in how the items are shipped. A lot of the time my items get shipped by USPS, which never comes in 2 days, and half the time USPS marks the item as delivered but doesn't actually deliver the package for another couple of days. The last issue I have with Amazon required 4 calls to Amazon customer service just to get someone who spoke enough and was competent enough to understand the problem, and even then nothing was does to resolve the issue. There Instant Prime tv steaming is mediocre, with a selection that mostly consists of outdated movies and shows that weren't even popular or heard of when that did air on tv back in the 80's. When they do add new content (usually once every 2-3 months) you may get ONE good movie or series, and the rest you have never heard of before. Every time I go to use Amazon, it always results with disappointment and dissatisfaction."
amazon	renz	2015-11-09T18:14:00Z	5	"First of all I have the need to let everybody know that ""AMAZON ROCKS"" buying thru them have been a Worry Free Experience every time even when you buy from a third party seller with an abusive return policy like the one described bellow Amazon always has stand by me (The Costumer) .I had an abusive return  experience from HVAC / IAQ SUPPLY they charge me   almost 50% of the cost of the item just because I decided to return the item in the same condition I received it, plus you need to expend your own money to ship it  back to them .If you buy from them make sure you really going to keep it if not you will suffer the consequences. The key included makes it very difficult to  screw on and off. For the price sold it should have an screw driver key included but it did not.This same review will post on Google as well."
amazon	Max Murray	2015-11-08T17:53:27Z	4	Totall agree.  The service is great and they have a great business.  But so many fake reviews on their site.  It's clear
amazon	LuLudovki	2015-11-07T07:26:15Z	2	"But I have to do it.Am I an idiot ? maybe as I checked reviews before purchasing an item to Amazon, all 5 stars reviews where promoting so well....The fact, after getting it, I wasn""t that impressed and checked only the bad reviews this time.Unfortunately, this made me realize that most 5 stars review were paid reviews, repeting the same writting style, with SEO sentences including whole product name.These 5 stars reviews by one time fake reviewers (they never come back again and never gave other feedback).That was for pura d'or shampoo, just have a look and judge by yourself.Despite that, Amazon offered a great service, I guess only that shampoo company is involved, but Amazon should clear these fake reviews."
amazon	Kevin Leigh	2015-11-05T00:06:22Z	2	Two issues on the same day. An item that was supposed to be two day shipping is now five. And I an item that's priced at &169 when I clicked on it was 399 and customer service excuse was that the item is now out of stock. They've  lost their magic for me.
amazon	Monica	2015-11-04T14:50:39Z	3	While the convenience of having things shipped to the house in a two day span for free(Prime--on some items) (a lot of disclaimers here) but when they are obviously trying to compete and raise prices on things you can get cheaper else where. Eh. I'd rather go to the store and get it then wait 2 days and pay more. The appeal isnt there anymore when youre not pricing competitively. Oh and the few times ive had issues they customer service treats you like a criminal/scam artist so yeah. Eh. I do it if its easier or cheaper but not my go to.
amazon	Fernanda	2015-10-28T13:37:19Z	3	I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a product. Dont appreciate the attitude.

amazon	Steve	2015-10-12T03:10:18Z	5	We RV full time and change locations frequently with a Prime account we still are able to receive things we order in the short time frame that we are at a location. The website makes it easy to change the shipping address. The couple times we have had an issue with something we ordered were amazingly resolved, both Amazon folks and the sellers made sure they made it right, returns are easy and well handled. This Company is simply amazing, we spend more money on Amazon than in any other retail, except groceries!
amazon	Ken Fitzpatrick	2015-10-08T17:48:24Z	2	Recently when I call Amazon customer service I cannot understand the agent that is answering the phone.  I have nothing against any other nationality, we are all human beings and must work to make a living. Amazon has every right to employ agents around the world, however they should have those agents assist the country they are from.  It makes for better communications all around.  When a customer cannot understand what an agent is trying to tell them mistakes can happen.  At one point in my conversation the agent said she would cancel my order and then correct the quantity in a new order.  This would delay the product that I purchased. I subscribe to Amazon Prime for the free quick shipping.  The last thing I need is someone changing my order because I couldn't understand what they are saying.Finally, if Amazon were to hire agents in their respective countries it would help the economy in each country and not take it away from another country. This contributes to stable employment and a sound economy for all.
amazon	Davis Jefferson	2015-10-08T13:03:45Z	5	Just to let you know that you are Amaz(o)ng
amazon	MrClean2u2	2015-10-08T12:34:47Z	5	Amazon has everything you could possibly need all on one site.  I have recently signed up for Amazon Prime, so now I even get free shipping on most of the items I purchase.  By far; my go-to site when I'm looking to purchase something online.

amazon	Faiza	2015-10-03T17:29:38Z	1	They charged my card 40.3 USD and it's been three months, they tell me everyday they'll refund me, and they still didn't, they sent me an invalid check for my country, they are rude, they put me over the phone for hours and i have over 30 chat transcript, they are abusing customers, rude, they should be in jail for such behaviour. I still wait my 40.3 USD refund.
amazon	Jariska Woodside	2015-10-02T22:43:16Z	4	Don't get me wrong I love amazon (so far-----this was my first time) What i didn't like was how they send all my packages in different boxes. I don't live in america, so i had to pay for every box that came to my country. Somethings where very small.
amazon	MG	2015-10-02T02:25:37Z	1	I order from Amazon ALL the time and I was happy with them, until yesterday when they decided to charge my account for $300+ dollars twice for one order. One of the charges was still pending and the other one was charged. I called the customer service department and they couldn't help me so the transferred me to a different person. I started explaining to the CSR and suddenly the call dropped. So, I had to call again and went through the same process. The person that was helping me, Ryan J. tried to blame it on my bank saying that it was their fault because they didn't drop the charges. So, we called the bank three way, and right away the bank rep said that Amazon authorized my cc twice. Ryan even went ahead and said he saw the two authorizations on his end but that it had the same authorization number. The bank was trying to figure out how to drop the pending authorization and turned to ask Ryan something and Ryan had already hung up the phone with out letting us know.   Thanks Ryan for nothing. It is the beginning of the month I have to pay my bills and Amazon has my $300+ tight up from my bank.
amazon	JR	2015-10-01T08:57:52Z	1	They charge cards that were deleted from my account causing all sorts of problems. They charge for items without my authorize and then refused to talk about it until I filed a formal complaint, only to change their reasoning. Do not trust Amazon. I don't believe I have given any other company a negative review here.
amazon	Reviews	2015-09-29T17:11:25Z	3	I had some pretty bad online orders before, and of course at last I jumped to Amazon, well the order came pretty quick, in around 5-6 days ( I am talking about international shipping) but the shipping fee is ridiculous! I bought two books and the shipping fee is more expensive than the books! -_-

What a load of bulls...!I written Amazon a mail. They answered very fast. This is what they write;Hello,""I'm sorry for any misunderstanding about our free shipping option. This option applies only to U.S. delivery addresses.You'll find our current international shipping rates on our Help pages:However, as an exception place a new order and please write us back with the order ID we'll either refund or waive off the shipping charge associated with it.I hope this solution works for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.""Good service. They didnt have to refund, but i would like it was more easy to se these things, so i dont have to be so frustreted. It is kind of a jungle to find these things out. And its kind of misleting, that they say free shipping. And dont say it only in the us. But cheap shipping prices thoug."
amazon	Murtaza Contractor	2015-09-11T21:45:48Z	1	I ordered an item (order # 112-7263128-0264216) on 29th Aug & was promised delivery date between 8-11 Sept. Same day as I was expecting the item (11th), I got an email saying your item wont be delivered on time.When I called customer care supervisor (Rudolf) he mentioned that we prioritize orders with 2 day shipping & that's why you didn't received the item just because you chose free shipping.Amazon service has gone down hill but they keep dropping standard every day. They accepted the order even when they didn't had the item & didn't shipped.

amazon	Mike	2015-09-07T14:46:09Z	3	Yes, the prices on Amazon are great and the selection is awesome, but their constant pushiness to sign up to prime is annoying.I know that it's how you guys make your money, but start off by adding free shipping globally, and then, maybe, it will be justified...

amazon	Ray	2015-09-03T22:33:53Z	5	I can't deny that amazon has always made it right. If a product has been misrepresented, defective or has some other problem, my money is refunded and the shipping to return it is always free. Also, when something didn't arrive by the promised shipping date, they extended my Amazon prime membership a month. I'll take that. I've also ordered the wrong cables for a kindle and they helped me to get the right ones and didn't charge me extra. I am really satisfied with their customer service. One of the many reason, I'll stick with them.

I always get quick deliveries and I know that my package will be there when I get home. I have never had any issues with Amazon and I have already recommended it to so many people!If you haven't purchased anything from Amazon I would recommend you do just to try it out. You wont be disappointed.

amazon	Afshin Yazdi	2015-08-24T14:51:45Z	1	I ordered an item from Amazon. They promised delivery on 21/08/15. I then recieve an email saying that delivery was delayed and i wouldnt recieve the item on this date. Even though it was on a next day delivery. They made me purchase a new item for it to be delivered on 22/08/15, then refund me the original order i placed , i was then told by the customer service agent that i will recieve a gesture of goodwill and free delivery on my next order. However as the customer agent didnt leave any notes and now amazon are not honouring what was offered to me. I have spoken to 3 supervisors and they have not resolved the issue. They emailed me back but didnt answer the question i asked. Absolutely rubbish customer service and they said they would rather me close my account then honour what was promised to me.
amazon	JeffM	2015-08-24T09:47:22Z	4	Whatever you can think of, you can buy it there. It's pretty safe and reliable. Especially of you're a prime user. One great thing about Amazon is that you also have the option to sell stuff yourself.
amazon	Alex	2015-08-21T23:52:06Z	5	I've ordered $100's of merch from amazon and have had a pleasant and hassle free experience all around.

When i called to get a refund or return it, I felt like they treated me like I was some scam artist trying to make a dollar.  Not everyone is like that and I understand caution but to start off with that attitude is disrespectful and uncalled for. All over a stuffed doll.
amazon	Angel	2015-08-11T13:51:28Z	1	"Amazon.com is an overpriced store that claims to offer ""free shipping"" for Prime Members, yet they encourage sellers to include the shipping price in the cost of the item. Everything is much more expensive than your local grocery store. Additionally, if you complain, they go back and delete all of your consumer reviews to try and ""punish"" you. Closing my Amazon account today!"

I googled and did everything i could to get it to work and to test the issue. Turns out the remotes infrared doesn't work. I didn't want to hassle with them so I bought a universal remote and now it works fine. My point is if I can do a simple google search and find out the issue (and that its one of the biggest complaints about this model) why wouldn't your techs check before selling?"
amazon	Lindsey Nopperson	2015-07-16T17:15:48Z	1	On average, I've probably spent close to 10k a year through Amazon, as I have a lot of subscribe and save products, and sometimes shop big ticket items there. They used to have great CS. Now they won't take responsibility for ANYTHING. They (as in Amazon itself - I took a screenshot of who the seller is) ship the wrong product. They and their subsidiary blames the other party, each one saying only the other can fix it. Signs you up for a credit card, provides no account info, tells you to contact the other company's customer service department and spend 3 hours on hold with them. Seller labels their 10 dollar product as compatible with another device (in the title - FOR device XYZ), isn't compatible, only works with another brand. Amazon wants you to drive to the UPS store to ship back the 10 dollar item before refunding.I used to buy things from Amazon for the customer service. Now, I will ONLY shop there for things that are cheaper. Customer service is no longer better than anyone else.
amazon	laura scarter	2015-07-15T19:31:05Z	5	I simple love them, I must say that I buy almost everything from them, much, much professional than ebay. I even buy their products like tablets and other gadgets.

It's impressively user friendly. Amazon Prime is an awesome service with many little features (music, movies, etc.) that were pleasant bonuses as well.
amazon	Jane Kosher	2015-07-12T13:30:29Z	4	Amazon is my online bookstore and I bought hundreds of books from them. Lately I started buying kindle books because the normal books take too long to arrive (2 weeks). Kindle books could be cheaper (sometimes are more expensive than hardcover)

Whether people agree with it or not. You will always have someone that agrees, as well as disagrees. If you guys decided to ban a piece of American history, then you should ban the sales of Soviet Flags as well. As this flag and its representation goes contrary to how this country was founded. Could be considered very offensive as well amongst many Americans far and wide. This is the United States of America we should have the freedom to chose what we want to buy. I'm sick of businesses going along with this government that thinks they can dictate our lives. I think this was a total mistake Amazon. I hope my opinion is considered."

He completely understood where I was coming from, unlike Newegg who takes a good 2 weeks to process a refund, needs an investigations team for the whole thing ,etc. Not to mention the prime with a free 30 day trial!

I needed a new starter for my Jeep recently, and though years before I would've gone to the car part sites and compared prices, this time I decided to give Amazon a try. It's great; I found a starter for half the price anybody else was offering.

They sent me one gallon way later than the estimated delivery date.  Then after more than three months and multiple phone calls they finally sent me an e-mail saying they couldn't even get the oil.  Needless to say I haven't been able to drive my for months.  Thank god I have another vehicle to drive or else I would have been royally screwed.  Thanks for nothing amazon.
amazon	Casper Petersen	2015-06-17T02:19:36Z	1	I happily placed an order after being in contact with one of Amazon's associates. She ensured me, that there would be absolutely no problems with tax, shipping etc. - if there should be a problem, I should just take contact to Amazon, and they would then cancel the charge from the carrier. HOWEVER - now I'm standing here with a charge from my carrier, and Amazon won't step in. Not even after showing direct evidences to them. They run away from multiple vows, and simply don't care. Once the order is placed - good luck. You're sailing your own boat. Can't recommend, not even for my enemy.Amazon - you can freely contact me, so we may now can find a solution. Until, will this review remain as it is

amazon	ZQubed	2015-06-12T14:42:09Z	2	"Amazon really pushes its Prime subscription service.  Though it has several benefits, the one promoted heavily is free 2 day shipping on Prime eligible products.  This benefit was really the only benefit of interest for me.It is important to note that Prime eligible products are often a few dollars more expensive than non-prime products.  In essence, they recoupe their two day shipping cost.  The standard shipping cost is generally already built in as the non-prime products are often free ground shipping anyway.My problem is that about half of my orders don't arrive w/in their ""guaranteed"" delivery date timeframe.  In one case an item was supposed to be delivered Saturday and it was delivered Tuesday.  In another case I ordered several items.  One I needed immediately.  On that item I paid for 1-day shipping.  The item was packaged together with my two day shipping items and delivered in two days.  There have been several other instances where items simply weren't delivered in the two day timeframe which Amazon guarantees.  They claim they can't control shippers.  Fine, but that's not my problem. If your service providers can't meet your guaranteed timeline, then you need to compensate members for failing ot meet your guarantee."

Luckily, amazon has the best prices (I've found that the amazon fulfilled businesses are great) and the best selection, with great honest reviews on the products. I was able to build my home studio on the cheap, and was able to see exactly what I would need based on the suggested products and the reviews. Anyone looking to buy mixers, mics, earphones, acoustic treatment, etc. should definitely look to Amazon.
amazon	John	2015-06-09T16:59:45Z	1	They steal $99 from you when you sign up for the free trial.  Then you get someone called Vohor (Yes that is his name and he even spelled it for me and he would not give me an employee number after he would just ignore what i was saying) on the phone and he will not transfer you to a supervisor.  They will not refund the full amount they steal from you.

amazon	Kenneth Hammond	2015-06-06T18:47:14Z	5	I was shocked the first time I looked back through my order history to find an item I wanted to re-order. I cannot believe how many things I have purchased from Amazon in the past 5 years!!! It was an enlightening experience to go through soooo many pages, Amazon has become my automatic go-to site to purchase just about anything. I don't buy everything from them, but I darn sure look there first before I check any other websites. I am a disabled veteran and live in a home for disabled vets, and haven't left here in 4 years to shop as the busses cause me too much pain, so most of my purchases are online. Also we have around 650 members here and many have me find and buy items for them online as well. What else can I say but....Thank the Lord for Amazon.com!!!!
amazon	Daniel Leibiziet	2015-06-06T07:15:37Z	5	Amazon is great! Simple and sweet, but its true! One of the great modern marvels and I'm not sure where I'd be without it!!
amazon	Rob Lyon	2015-06-05T22:46:24Z	1	I ordered a dining set and was told that I could return for a 10% restocking fee which turned into 20% when I actually wanted to return. Was also socked with shipping costs back to Ontario, CA.
amazon	Dharani Rao	2015-06-05T07:02:09Z	4	Amazon is the best seriously I have ordered a Yureka on 6 May 2015 when I got the product it was not working properly when i called the customer service they send the person to pick the product same day and they refunded the money next day this is how companies should be Flipkart has worst customer service and I would recommend not to buy any product from Flipkart
amazon	Samantha Billings	2015-06-03T15:57:11Z	4	I only buy from amazon if they are the ONLY one with the product for the best price. If another site is a bit higher I will go with them because you can actually get more product information that way. Also Amazon will not intervene if there is a quality issue. The other thing I do not like about Amazon is that allow foreign based sellers to use their site...making American believe they are USA based. I have found that many vendors are just from Ebay and based in China. I gave them 4 stars because when you do buy items arrive pretty quick. I am not sure how they will stay in business based on some of the silly free shipping. I purchased once $30.00 worth of stickers and received one the next day and balance of order 3 day later. They had to have lost money. And I gave them the 4 stars based on their Amazon Prime TV service. They offer shows that other do not.
amazon	Jung-Cheng Hsiang	2015-06-02T08:39:48Z	5	"A large market for customers to do price check, and choose their desirable stuff. In the end, Amazon can probably trap you in the house. Now It's probably going to make it ""worse"", since Amazon is starting offering same day delivery in major cities.Overall, Amazon has almost no match in goods variety, prices, and customer service. Definitely recommend Amazon -- my favortie."
amazon	niels solberg	2015-05-29T22:11:30Z	5	I have made hundred of orders with amazon.com and have never had any problems with delivery or service. Highly appreciated and valued place to do your shopping!

amazon	Frank Watson	2015-05-29T03:09:32Z	5	I go to amazon for almost all of my online shopping. They have what I need, they have reasonable prices, and they ship quickly. Hard to go wrong with amazon.
amazon	m moore	2015-05-27T09:27:07Z	5	Amazons Great. My biggest issue was that the free shipping was slow, but Prime now just works PERFECTLY. Now I order when I need something & I do not have to try to batch things together into larger orders. Amazon is reliable & fast.
amazon	Aizhan	2015-05-20T18:59:37Z	5	Amazon is the best. I've been ordering from them for years now and have never (not once) had any kind of issues. The packages get delivered faster than you expect. Awesome company! Thank you, Amazon for making my life easier. :)
amazon	Will de Dill	2015-05-20T08:26:57Z	1	I am SO VERY annoyed.First of all Amazon delivering my parcel to a neighbour I don't get on with (every one has one) without my concern.Opened the box this morning to assemble the good to my surprise SCREW BITS MISSING!!!!  Has taken off all excitement we had for the product, and hours after posting my review, noticed it didn't get published by Amazon. Isn't this MISLEADING and DISHONEST to future customers?TO AMAZON DON'T JUST PUT THE GOOD LOOKING APPLES ON TOP OF THE BASKET CUSTOMERS WANT TO KNOW WHATS ROTTEN BENEATH - POOR SERVICE.
amazon	Nanna Bruun	2015-05-18T16:00:40Z	5	excellent delivering! I got the package a day earlier than expected and it was very easy to track the package and see how far it was. I ordered from Denmark and only payed a small prize for taxes when it arrived (44 kr)

amazon	dillon	2015-05-05T21:32:35Z	1	I was selling products on Amazon and had a guy that was not a customer and had never bought the product I sold (I know this because I am the only person who makes or sells the product) give a negative review on 2 of my products for IDK what reason. I contacted amazon over 6 times trying to get this matter taken care of and they where NO help. I removed my listing and I am going to stick to selling on ebay.
amazon	Ted Hohney	2015-05-01T12:45:03Z	1	I ordered a very small product front amazon on the16th. The issue is that I paid $3.99 to ship a product that weighs less than a pound and my expected delivery is May 8th. I don't know what the deal with my package is, but I do know that I will NEVER do business on amazon again!Amazon, in 2015 you should be able to get a package from California to AZ in less than 3 weeks!  you suck, one star for you!
amazon	Joshua	2015-04-28T01:41:14Z	5	amazon is where i find all of my online products, i love it.
amazon	Tamar Alexander	2015-04-23T23:19:06Z	3	I wish I could give Amazon 5 stars, but I have had some very frustrating customer service experiences with them recently. I recently bought a remote control and I ended up with a used remote that someone must have returned. I bought it through Amazon directly and not even a third-party seller. I learned my lesson there. I then had to talk to customer service and the person I spoke with did not really understand what I was even talking about. It was incredibly frustrating. Amazon has great prices and they ship fast, but they are a massive company that just doesn't get it right all of the time.
amazon	jon doesh	2015-04-23T16:34:46Z	5	They have lots of stuff and it comes in the mail fast.
amazon	Martin Cummerou	2015-04-16T09:03:25Z	5	Took awhile but i got a refund for my payment even though it was my fault! I had not checked if i had to pay VAT for my items and was able to send my package back completly free! Not only that the books i had ordered a few weeks before had arrived 2 weeks before the estimated time! Just in time for my 20 hour flight to Thailand, truly great!
amazon	Sami Hunt	2015-04-16T03:34:33Z	5	Honestly could not live without it. Love not having to leave the house to go shopping!
amazon	james booker	2015-04-13T04:20:51Z	4	"I always order Otcs meds with them, like melatonin, I do not understand WHY the sellers do not put the product labels of each product on the sale page! is pretty insane, there are things that only have a name like "" stress tabs "" and it just show you the bottle without any product label."
amazon	Matt Scharf	2015-04-12T22:08:18Z	5	The company protects the buyer. I have order products that did not function properly or meet my exceptions and amazon has always taken the product back. I have even mistakenly purchased and incorrect item and amazon has taken care on me. Shipping times are always accurate and packing is 5 star. The customer service has to be one of the best. Over all I have nothing bad to say about this company. I purchase a majority of my items from them and will continue to do so.
amazon	Heron	2015-04-06T17:56:03Z	5	The best online store!
amazon	AJ	2015-04-03T20:27:49Z	2	Amazon seems to be moving away from being a direct retailer and becoming a marketplace for third party resellers.  This is great for Amazon, they don't have to do anything except transfer an order and collect their percentage of the cut.For the consumer, the plus side of this is that if there is a problem Amazon can serve as a mediator between the customer and reseller.  Unfortunately it usually takes several tries for Amazon's customer service department to grasp the meaning even the simplest complaint.  The consumer can also see reviews and ratings for each third party seller.  But beware, Amazon manipulates these ratings through both direct and indirect means.Proceed with caution when buying products from a third party seller on amazon.com, and do not trust the reseller ratings on amazon.com
amazon	Ernest	2015-04-02T07:25:33Z	5	item received very good phone would buy again
amazon	dlith	2015-04-01T13:06:03Z	2	I got roped into prime after a 30 day free trial and have used the 2 day shipping several times. Living somewhat far from stores and shopping, it has been really nice to be able to order something I need and having it at my door in two days instead of waiting until I feel like driving the half hour to go pick it up myself. That being said...I have been trying to take advantage of the Prime Instant Video aspect of my membership. On three occasions now (in 6 months) shows or movies that I have been in the middle of, or that I have added to my watch list, went from being free to being an additional charge to watch - within 24 hours time! Imagine marking a movie on Monday night that you were thrilled to have included in your membership only to find out by Tuesday night that you now had to pay. Even worse, imagine watching one episode of a series on Wednesday, that was included in your membership, and turning on the next episode on Thursday to find that it is no longer included. Amazon seems to be luring you in to their 'perks' only to raise all prices and scam you out of your pennies in other ways. It is not good practice and does not give me a good feeling about giving my business to this company.
amazon	Billy Buckley	2015-03-31T13:44:39Z	1	not only do I pay a monthly fee, but I have to pay for the films too. The free films are rubbish.
amazon	Sarah Hensley	2015-03-27T18:50:39Z	4	I shop on Amazon for all the odds and ends I seem to need. Sometimes I use the sight to get a better idea of the market of a product, and rely heavily on reviews. I never buy anything without a review. I have never had a problem with their customer service. I do caution people that when in the marketplace, customer service is not always as fast.
amazon	Juank	2015-03-27T02:00:12Z	5	excellent product selection, excellent prices, not always the cheapest, but AmazonPrime makes it all worth it. I buy everything from them, and I mean everything
amazon	M.T.K	2015-03-24T14:51:26Z	5	"Amazon is the best place to shop online. Period. Customer service goes way beyond anything you'd expect from a normal company. They are not ""normal"" in any sense of the word. They're amazing!"
amazon	Mariusz Szemansky	2015-03-23T10:41:27Z	5	Their e-book reader, the Kindle has a very extensive library of titles to choose from. Amazon's customer service is fantastic - they replaced my kindle free of charge.
amazon	Mika	2015-03-20T16:47:15Z	3	"We bought a Danby DAR044A4WDD compact fridge after seeing 4 stars average from 594 Amazon customer reviews. Looked at questions answered also, stating the door was reversible. I took a minute to search by model number and there was ONE review on this model. The site clumped 13 different models, including outmoded ones, into one set of reviews making the reviews misleading and useless. It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups. Reviews are grouped, ALL purchasers of Genius microwaves of any model, ALL flavors of Green Mountain. Useless!Last month we bought a Little Tykes coupe from Quidsi an amazon store, then discovered that the same thing with a trailer was available through Amazon directly. Went to cancel the first one WITHIN FOUR MINUTES and we couldn't because it had ""shipped"". We had to take delivery and return it which cost us $14 UPS. What a scam... Other than constantly and increasingly dealing with questionable information, if you do research on several websites and don't rely on Amazon to make your decisions, then you know EXACTLY what you want, they are quite amazingly good."
amazon	Marcelo Franca	2015-03-14T19:02:50Z	1	I'm very surprise to see so many 5 stars around here..maybe I'm crazy or maybe they just don't car about me..Starting that I have received my order 15 days after the purchase date and between 3 items 1 was not working BPM, no telephone numbers if you need to speak with a customer service and the emails I have been receiving  is totally out of context...I don't know what I can do I think buying from this people was a big mistake. I'm feeling stupid now...I'll dispute my entire order  and I'll return all the items ..this company does not deserve my trust or my business.
amazon	Mary	2015-03-14T18:39:53Z	5	I purchased a beautiful teak shower bench and enjoyed it beauty and functionality until 7 months after purchase it got wobbly.  I tried to fix it and it was still wobbly.  Contacted Decoteak directly (purchased thru Amazon) and heard back within hours.  Problem solved immediately--without charge, they send me a new, even better model, fully assembled.  No hassle, no questions asked--just perfection in customer service.  I will forever do business with a company that takes pride in their product and service.
amazon	Alpay Tutu	2015-03-12T10:02:36Z	5	Top notch e-commerce solution provider. I use it as a professional seller as well as a regular buyer. No surprises, always on-time deliveries. Enjoying the new amazon prime features too
amazon	Ed Soton	2015-03-12T08:24:17Z	5	Great as always thank you
amazon	Erran Fain Yearty	2015-03-11T13:49:16Z	4	While not perfect and with a design that is looking a bit out of date, Amazon is still my preferred source for online shopping.  When dealing with Amazon directly, shopping is quick and efficient with easy returns.  Purchases thru the Marketplace vendors can still be a bit hit or miss so I hope they find better solutions for that in the future.
amazon	della	2015-03-10T14:31:01Z	5	and I'm not the only one.  Fast and efficient deliveries every time, Ive spent hundreds of pounds with them and not ever had one single problem or complaint!!  you rock guys :)
amazon	amy	2015-03-06T17:47:22Z	5	I usually buy my stuff from ebay but I decided to try amazon because I heard they had good prices and fast delivery. I found a lot of stuff on special so I bought and the delivery time was alright.

amazon	Richard	2015-02-25T20:49:47Z	5	I've bought from them several time and have always gotten what i've expected. Great company!
amazon	Ada McCarty	2015-02-24T16:57:03Z	4	Received a very nasty letter from Amazon a few days ago regarding my suspicious purchasing behavior. I was really shocked because normally Amazon is all about making the customer's shopping experience enjoyable. At any rate, instead of thanking me for all the tens of thousands of dollars of orders I put through their system (I'm a buyer for our company) they said I was abusing their Amazon prime membership.  Who knew!   At any rate,  Amazon gets almost everything else right - but every so often they do make mistakes. Here are a few I've experienced: 1)Nasty letters sent regarding policy violations (of which we have had none, but that doesn't prevent them from sending nastygrams).  2) Several times, they have posted items for sale which they did not have in stock.  They wont let other sellers do this, but Amazon does this a lot (items that will ship in 30 days or longer somtimes).   This seems rather sneaky.  3)  Items not arriving on time.  If you advertise 2 day business shipping, you should get it to a customer in 2 business days. Several times now my Prime purchases did not arrive on time  Really minor issues, and Amazon continues to be the gold standard for e-commerce. But, they are  worth a mention in case an Amazon exec is ever looking for ways to improve their service :)
amazon	Joseph Leach	2015-02-24T02:13:42Z	5	the king of ecommerce every product at your finger tips with a click of a button and tons of reviews to match prime convenience no friction simplest and most satisfying shopping experience in my opinion
amazon	Garin	2015-02-23T12:50:37Z	5	Amazon prime just delivers it all, worth the money for sure and has never let me down.

amazon	Anthony Daniel	2015-02-14T19:02:05Z	5	I am using amazon since 2011 for my kindle ebooks and i never found a single fault about services, quality and all other stuff. I really appreciate the amazon team you are rocking.
amazon	Heather	2015-02-10T16:37:44Z	5	I have been an Amazon customer for years and I just can't say enough about how awesome they are! I've used Amazon Prime (when I can afford it), Amazon Mom, and loved every part of it! Even when you have to pay shipping, generally its not too expensive, and you can find just about anything you could possibly want!
amazon	Majeeda	2015-02-06T06:00:42Z	4	"Amazon is good I actually enjoy shopping at Amazon they tend to have good deals in fact I've often found products at Amazon that I couldn't find anywhere else What do I ""like"" well there's variety of products as said above they offer so many different products and services also their gift cards never expire so if you have a gift card it stays on your account until you spend it, and they have a good digital music, movie, and physical disk, movie collection and great mp3 downloads a nice free cloud service to store your music and filesWhat do I dislike well the rate to qualify for free shipping use to be $25.00 but now it's $35.00 and if your order does not reach the $35 mark it won't qualify for free shipping, and their regular shipping cost can be a bit too high in my opinionNext thing worth mentioning as a negative is their product prices are constantly fluctuating also sometimes private amazon seller will sell you a fake or broken product so sometimes you have to be a extra sharp buyer to get an honest deal and avoid getting scammed with private sellersBut the good thing is Amazon's customer service is pretty good and fair and if you happen to have an issue they are pretty good in terms of helping to resolve your issuePrime, it's not for me $100 bucks a year is too risky for my budget and the few nice extras don't seem worth the nail biter every year but it's a nice feature for those that don't mind the yearly wallet pounderOver all Amazon is good and I would give the service a full five star rating but their are some negatives to consider such as receiving the occasional counterfeit or broken item though it does not happen often it's still annoying whenever it does happen also their shipping cost change depending on what item you purchase meaning there's no flat rate shipping or free shipping unless you spend $35.00 or have a $100.00 prime membership. would I recommend Amazon of course I would in fact I have recommended the service before to friends even kind strangers it's a good site good service."
amazon	Janet	2015-02-06T05:10:10Z	5	Amazon Prime + great prices make shopping for myself and others a breeze. The 2-day shipping means when I procrastinate I can always rely on them to get me something quick. Only watchout is CPG items, I have noticed those can be more expensive than my local target or walgreens.
amazon	Jane Smith	2015-02-06T00:13:44Z	5	Who needs to go out now when we have Amazon prime! The subscription works out much cheaper rather than going out in your car, burning gas, paying for a ticket etc!Amazon is definately the king at the moment leaving ebay behind which is full of fake products
amazon	Christian Krog Rasmussen	2015-02-04T09:39:33Z	5	I've used an amazon EC2 to run a small linux and didn't understand the free tier, asked for help and got an amazing reply very detailed and very fast!

amazon	michelsrose	2015-01-20T05:20:32Z	4	I have been using Amazon.com for many years and they have not failed me yet. I used the online site when I wanted to buy books shipped to me in Japan and I saved a lot money on shipping. Now, I do most of my Christmas shopping here, and I often find the best prices around at Amazon.com.   The addition of the Prime service has really amped up the level of service you receive. You can find ratings of items before you buy and the vendors also are peer reviewed. Overall, this is the best place to start your online shopping adventure.
amazon	Pete	2015-01-14T12:34:27Z	3	OK - not sure about their human rights ethics, but delivered my orders ok in my time of need
amazon	Penny	2015-01-14T02:34:09Z	2	"If you're just a customer of Amazon, you most likely love them. If you're involved with Amazon deeper than just buying, you probably feel like me. They can be extremely unpleasant and difficult to deal with. Also, their ""free shipping"" isn't really free."

The customer service rep I got was amazing! She took down the incident and started up investigations right then and there- On a Friday afternoon! Assuring me and my husband that they would replace the items if the seller still had any available or they would refund the full amount of the items. Thank you so much Amazon.Com! You guys saved the holidays for us :)

A few times it seems lately they would mess up my order, the first time oik it was fine but than the second time I am thinking what is going on... I called customer service and they told me there having problem with my address. I am thinking well you never had any other issues before. They did not give me a straight answer as to why.
amazon	Brad Helmink	2014-12-12T18:19:22Z	5	It's very hard to compete with Amazon and Prime. I love everything about it and order from there weekly.
amazon	toya	2014-12-10T21:56:53Z	5	This Is the perfect place to shop online. there's cheap prices then u would find in store costumer service is always there to help and the sellers contact you on time ! they offer free return labels for something's  you don't like you can print out a free shipping label and they will give u a refund as soon as they get it . great business .
amazon	JLH	2014-12-10T18:09:04Z	5	Their customer service, breadth of product and fast shipping are most impressive and a good example for companies to follow. They also continue to evolve and meet the needs of today's consumer.
amazon	Emilie Enoksen	2014-12-08T06:29:17Z	2	Well, i loved Amazon until this one time came that i was looking for a certain product and order it. I thought i could have it by just a few days or maybe a week but it got too long. The shipping was way too long and i got really disappointed. Like a lot. :(
amazon	Mike Pritchard	2014-12-05T21:19:25Z	4	Amazon Prime has been well worth the money and has made shopping an even easier, one stop experience.  Definitely recommend.
amazon	Robert	2014-12-04T23:44:14Z	4	But I won't act on it because the prices and delivery time is too good :\
amazon	Sasa	2014-12-03T04:55:10Z	5	Excellent customer service! Very easy to speak to someone if needed. Items are as described and they appear to be coping well with christmas rush. I had to wait an extra day to receive an item that was supposed to be next day delivery. Amazon offered to refund my delivery cost even though it was only 1 day late.Fantastic service! :) 5 gold stars
amazon	Susie Hay	2014-12-02T20:15:19Z	5	"Amazon is my ""go to place"" whenever I need to find something at a great price.  The shipping is always fast too."
amazon	ddogg	2014-11-26T14:41:41Z	3	I found some good deals on Amazon, but also waited weeks to get those. Customer service is meh, they don`t really care about your orders
amazon	Irene Freegard	2014-11-25T15:27:33Z	5	Have spent hours perusing this site and bought lots of gifts which were delivered easily and quickly. Would recommend using amazon prime for even faster service!
amazon	Mannie B	2014-11-21T00:16:21Z	5	I will be a customer for life. Really love their commitment to offering the best value and customer service out there.
amazon	Mansi Narang	2014-11-20T11:50:14Z	5	Loyal customer!
amazon	Ben Williams	2014-11-19T21:15:10Z	5	Prime user for life!
amazon	Kathryn Dyche Dechairo	2014-11-14T23:24:40Z	4	My go to site for most things.  Love the Prime feature and the fast delivery.
amazon	Jenna Davis	2014-11-14T16:29:57Z	5	Amazon is my go to site when I need to buy something. Tons of great products and useful reviews. I also like how i can donate a percentage of my purchase to a charity of my choice. Such a great website!
amazon	Salmaan Ahmad	2014-11-13T15:43:20Z	5	Love being able to shop while occupied in boring meetings or on the toilet.
amazon	Gabi	2014-11-13T03:20:19Z	5	I've been using Amazon for years, and I couldn't be happier. I have Amazon Prime, and I love the 2 day shipping. Once in a while, a package will come in late, but their customer support is quick and friendly. Returning items is easy, and the one time I had an issue with a shipment (a flash drive), they overnighted me a replacement at no cost. When the original flash drive finally came in two weeks late, I let them know, and they told me to keep both. I love Amazon, and I buy almost everything but groceries from them.
amazon	Brian Kwong	2014-11-12T19:41:43Z	5	Been a customer many years with Prime. They always try to do right by me. Sometimes items never arrive though but Amazon always makes up for it. Been noticing the time to actually ship an order is getting a bit longer and longer but cant complain too much. Just cant depend to get anything on a deadline.
amazon	Barb Mattheis	2014-11-08T03:08:03Z	5	Amazon is great. You get almost everything there and they have very good service to offer.
amazon	JD Singh	2014-11-07T02:57:47Z	5	Love Shopping at Amazon.  I could find just about everything at Amazon at a great price.
amazon	Aisha Gonzalez	2014-11-05T13:09:59Z	5	They have delivered my products every time on schedule. Also, payment modes are flexible too. I like shopping here.
amazon	Jan Linslow	2014-11-01T18:59:39Z	5	I've ordered many times from Amazon.com. Items always arrive quickly (sometimes the following day!) and notification has always been prompt when any issues arise. Shipping is free on most items which is awesome.The only complaint I could possibly make is that the .ca site doesn't carry as many items as the .com site does.
amazon	Melinda	2014-11-01T00:35:49Z	5	I order almost everything from Amazon. It comes quickly, before deadline, packaged well. I have called their customer service line and had helpful, friendly reps. I do highly recommend Amazon.
amazon	Christian Jiang	2014-10-31T22:01:03Z	5	I ordered a Giant Alpha Edition Toothless toy (from How to Train Your Dragon 2, a movie). It arrived even before the prearranged day.Five stars: it's fast and the products are not ruined. Good job! They'll also notify you when the product is ready to be shipped etc. etc..
amazon	Martin	2014-10-31T19:19:03Z	1	My purchases these days have been connected to too much problems and delays, so i don't find it worth the money to spend anything at amazon.They also has the most creepy and weird rating/review system that are censored almost instantly if you try to put something true around the failures of delivery system or order problems. Stay away from amazon and feed the others that is my advice. Amazon is not a friendly giant, its a ugly cyclops with no morals.
amazon	Shanice L.	2014-10-31T15:25:05Z	5	I find myself looking for excuses to buy things on Amazon since I'm lazy about going to the store. Found a great Halloween costume and had it overnighted for cheap. The way they do reviews is also very helpful
amazon	Rudy Vasquez	2014-10-31T09:29:24Z	4	fast shipping and unbeatable prices.
amazon	James	2014-10-28T18:05:14Z	5	I love Amazon. I've never had a problem when ordering items from Amazon itself. I did have a little bit of a mixup once with one of their partner vendors who sent me the wrong product, but everything worked out in the end. One of the reasons I like Amazon is for the reviews. You get some good information from people who already have and use the product you're thinking about buying.
amazon	nick.requette	2014-10-27T15:03:46Z	5	very convenient to order stuff online
amazon	Nikki	2014-10-24T23:46:32Z	3	I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.
amazon	jay	2014-10-24T20:38:09Z	5	I have great confidence in Amazon as an online seller but also the way they manage the other sellers that sell through the online store. The products always arrive quickly and you get great value.
amazon	chrisupi007	2014-10-23T20:24:57Z	5	I'm happy with all my shopping at Amazon. I have bought books, pillows, games, movies, adapters, batteries, and DIY stuff. Five stars because they deserve it.
amazon	Betty H	2014-10-22T13:51:21Z	5	Bought replacement batteries for my cell and it was fulfilled by Amazon.  Received the battery in less time then their expected delivery time.  Great communication and fast delivery. Pretty awesome in my book.
amazon	Kareem	2014-10-21T10:39:08Z	5	Two days ago I bought a small object (mobile phone cover).No delivery fees with amazon prime and today I just received the cover: simply amazing!And they sell almost everything... really good service and competitive prices!
amazon	Aileen Sim	2014-10-17T11:30:39Z	5	One of my favourite companies of all time. I use amazon a ton. I get almost all my books from Amazon, and a whole lot of other stuff too. For such big company, their customer service is amazing.
amazon	Greg Hachigian	2014-10-17T08:45:39Z	5	have a great experience when i shop on amazon. Always can find the products you want. Amazing!!!
amazon	Kenia	2014-10-14T23:47:55Z	5	"My experience with Amazon hasn't been 100% which may make individuals think why 5 stars? The reason is that Amazon stands behind their customers if anything occurs. For example, if my order is lost then Amazon takes responsibility and doesn't say ""It is not my problem, it is yours."" If I ever had any bad experiences, Amazon would try their best rectifying the problem and that is what I need. I need to know that I can trust who I am buying from."
amazon	Patrick Fargo	2014-10-14T13:18:56Z	5	I have used Amazon a lot, however you never really know how good an online seller is until something goes wrong. They messed up taking my payment, but when I got in touch with them, they resolved everything and even got the shipping upgraded to next day, so it didn't even make a difference to the time I would have got my order!
amazon	MartinS	2014-10-14T05:35:43Z	5	Love the prime experience. No need to worry about shipping costs and bundle orders. Some decent video-streaming option included.
amazon	Alina V	2014-10-08T21:01:09Z	4	Great company and quick delivery. I will buy from them again for sure.
amazon	Aaron Stead	2014-10-08T15:28:16Z	5	Amazon has it all, and is the default when I want to look for something. Anything. From household to tools for work, back to summer or winter fun items. Great site, efficient delivery, and easy to use. Thanks amazon!
amazon	Rick Forester	2014-10-07T22:00:10Z	5	I always have a great experience when i shop on amazon. And they always deliver quickly and take care of me as a customer. Highly recommend
amazon	Jerome	2014-10-03T21:52:06Z	4	I love Amazon, and it used to be a really good thing when amazon prime wasn't so expensive. Now, after their price hike, I'm going to downgrade my rating for them. Amazon, please bring back the reasonable pricing.
amazon	Michael Nielsen	2014-10-03T18:43:13Z	5	All went fine, and i got my stuff in Denmark.Love all the Amazon sites. And already used .com, .co.uk and .deI really hope to see a .dk at some point!
amazon	William Bennett	2014-10-03T13:18:00Z	4	Shopping at Amzon is a pleasure. Customer support service is helpful and fast.
amazon	Lauren Ring	2014-10-03T09:08:19Z	5	I appreciate amazon for having such a great customer service! Clearly stands out from most sites out there. I trust them so I am a loyal customer!
amazon	Paula Bruce	2014-10-02T18:23:58Z	5	I have bought tons of stuff from Amazon, everything from CDs to home theater systems to groceries.  The few times I've had issues, I've had no trouble getting satisfactory outcomes through customer service.  For the most part their prices are great too (though it always pays to double-check).
amazon	Joanna	2014-09-28T14:00:47Z	5	its great ! i buy everything there!
amazon	Gregor Manzur	2014-09-27T10:56:46Z	4	I will order again, prices are quite good and delivery works fast!
amazon	Mike Caudill	2014-09-22T16:38:05Z	5	the customer support is friendly, fast, and helpful.  i love the things they sell there.
amazon	Alena	2014-09-20T16:44:19Z	4	Just received my new watch. Just love it. It's been very good experiences shopping at Amazon for years.
amazon	Ivan Schegin	2014-09-18T20:06:58Z	4	I used them 3-4 times, the only problem is a long delivery but all in all it's amazing site.
amazon	WheelsMagoo	2014-09-17T21:30:18Z	4	"Amazon itself is great, the merchants they use can be rough at times.  I try to stick to ""sold and ships from amazon.com"" and have no trouble."
amazon	Dori	2014-09-17T21:21:09Z	5	I have purchased from Amazon twice and my first order was a Timex watch of which I was really happy with especially when it was cheaper by about $20 than the Timex site. The second time I ordered I was disappointed in the two shirts I purchased, but the return was not only easy but I got the refund as soon as UPS logged it into their system! I didn't have to wait until my return was received by the warehouse for me to get the refund. I was so shocked to see the refund in my account so fast!!! I've never experienced that with any other company before. That alone will make me a regular Amazon customer.
amazon	Katasha Schoonover	2014-09-16T15:48:04Z	5	I buy stuff from Amazon at least once a month. I have never had problems. If I need to return something it is quick and simple. I can find nearly anything I'm looking for at a great price. Highly reccomend.
amazon	Fran Salazar	2014-09-12T19:35:53Z	4	lots of stuff and i trust them.Fran.
amazon	Jay	2014-09-12T18:30:17Z	5	Amazon is the best online shopping site.  Become a prime member and get fast free shipping.  The wide selection and competitive prices coupled with the fast free shipping make it a no brainer to order on Amazon.
amazon	David T	2014-09-05T16:00:07Z	4	I love shopping on Amazon.  Its one of my favorite stores online.  Anything I am looking for I know I will be able to find on Amazon.  Check out is easy and fast.  I joined prime and now I get free shipping too!
amazon	Angelini Clara	2014-09-04T11:24:59Z	2	Amazon has many products on sale, but the quality of the goods is not good as before, the shipping fee is high but the shipping time is long, i do not like it!
amazon	Chaotic Good	2014-09-02T21:59:10Z	4	Amazon is a great place to shop, and I find that I’m able to find just about anything I need here, at cheaper prices than in-store. The categorization of items makes it easy to find what you’re looking for, and they list customer reviews and satisfaction ratings next to each product. They offer products from many different vendors, and list different options for buying a single item, so you can review different vendors’ prices and customer reviews before making a purchase. The only problem I have had in the past is a long wait to receive some items, but I’ve only had this issue with one vendor. My transactions have always been successfully completed, and I’ve never been charged more than expected. More often than not, my products are delivered more quickly than expected, and have never been received damaged or unusable. I shop on Amazon for pet supplies, books, costumes, gardening supplies, camping supplies, and other things. It is definitely a viable option when purchasing items online.
amazon	Jojo Awish	2014-09-02T18:54:33Z	5	I have always loved shopping through Amazon.com. I love how they offer the free trial for Amazon Prime which offers 2-day shipping. I wish they did not increase the annual subscription from $79 to $99 though, however, $8.25 per month is not bad though especially if you do a lot of online shopping, plus, you get to use Amazon video along with your Prime subscription. Although Amazon does not offer the cheapest prices all the time, you can still find a lot of good deals (sometimes the cheapest) from here and putting in mind the free shipping for a minimum of $35 (formerly $25) for eligible items, that is really awesome!
amazon	Jenny	2014-09-01T04:50:01Z	5	This site is great, and I bought countless things from this website, and every time I have gotten it. The shipping and handling goes very smoothly and I always get it on time. If not, earlier. This site is trustworthy and great for shopping when you don't feel like getting out of the house.
amazon	JULIETTE MCGEHEE	2014-09-01T03:50:59Z	5	I am a big fan of Amazon. I have been a customer for more than 10 years and it really is my go to site. Never had a bad experience. Has just about everything.
amazon	Julia	2014-08-25T20:52:47Z	5	Ordered many times from Amazon, the books always arrive before the day they were meant to, and sometimes on the actual day. My books always came in perfect condition. Shipping price is a little expensive, but I understand that`s because I live very far away. Best shopping online store.
amazon	Adel	2014-08-20T15:25:34Z	5	Best shopping site
amazon	John Clinton	2014-08-19T03:06:30Z	5	From Amazon Prime to reviews to everything you could possibly want, Amazon puts the customer first.  The best online merchant by far!  Not ready for the drones yet though, ha.
amazon	Kellie MacCartney	2014-08-15T15:30:49Z	5	First time I purchased from Amazon was about five years ago and since then I purchase a couple of times a year. For quite a few items it's my go to place as the prices are usually good and it's convenient. To date I have had no problems with any orders but maybe it's because of the kind of items I order, mainly books and occasional DVDs. All in all, a good experience and safe also.
amazon	asdfasdf	2014-08-14T13:19:28Z	3	I found some great deals, but also had terrible experience with customer service. I`m also against businesses that use monopolist tactics, so there`s that.
amazon	MelvinB87	2014-08-14T03:34:07Z	2	"I rented a textbook from a 3rd party seller named ""apex_media"". When I returned the book, Apex_media claimed I damaged the book. They charged me $299 for a book I hardly used. I contacted Amazon for help they said they'll looking into it. After a few weeks of waiting, I never received a response from Amazon. I called my credit card company to dispute the charge. 2 days later I got my money back from VISA"
amazon	Ross Anderson	2014-08-13T12:43:16Z	4	I do like Amazon, they have almost everything you could possibly need. I have had a couple delivery problems in the past but you expect that at some point. Overall though, I buy almost everything from Amazon and its almost always great.
amazon	Stop the scammers	2014-08-07T15:04:39Z	5	I trust Amazon more then I do eBay when it comes to buying and selling items.
amazon	Paul Willis	2014-08-03T03:04:07Z	5	One of the best internet companies. Always reliable but won't necessarily get the best bargain for your buck!
amazon	Mike	2014-07-31T16:47:26Z	5	I buy almost everything on Amazon.com now. They make it very easy to return items that don't fit or weren't what you were expecting. With amazon prime, I receive my order in a few days and usually pay less than at a normal store. No complaints!
amazon	Enrique Jones	2014-07-30T23:53:08Z	4	I chose the free shipping option and my order still arrived within three business days. Nice job Amazon!
amazon	James Holmes	2014-07-28T15:11:58Z	4	Only complain is that they should make it clearer when you are buying from someone outside of your home country.I also have had a problem when i have bought a product, paid for it, and then been told it is out of stock! Oh well, overall Amazon is a clear and easy site, customer reviews are very helpful when purchasing a new product.  Sort out your stock problems and i'll give 5 stars!
amazon	Noel Wade	2014-07-28T09:39:47Z	4	Amazon always seems to have the products that I want, I managed to order what I need and delivery was ok.
amazon	Matt Russel	2014-07-27T06:19:13Z	5	This is amazing! Greatest service, fastest support, feedback is good!
amazon	Elle	2014-07-26T00:41:06Z	5	I have been buying stuffs from this website that ranges from simple music to books to merchandise for the past couple of years. I never had (so far) any problems with the quality of the products, the delivery time is always within the specified date range.One of the things that I do like is the fact that I am able to track my packages almost in real time.It is one website for online shopping that I certainly trust and would definitely recommend to anyone.
amazon	Mark Hans	2014-07-24T13:09:28Z	3	I have ordered books and other gadgets from Amazon for almost two years.The product are always fine with good packaging.The shipment is not so fast the only thing that bothers me
amazon	Susan	2014-07-11T15:24:06Z	4	I have used Amazon for my online shopping for years.  I have never had any issues in with any of my orders.  I have purchased a variety of things from them in the past and will continue to do so in the future as it is very easy and convenient for me to locate what I need and have it shipped to me.  I do own two of their Kindle's and love both of them as I am an avid reader.  I would recommenced giving Amazon a try if you are looking for a place to shop online.
amazon	Abraham Smith	2014-07-08T03:35:11Z	5	good product, shipping on time
amazon	Jamie K.	2014-06-29T03:37:42Z	5	I've had another great experience with Amazon this past week and just wanted to give them a little more praise. I had signed up a couple weeks ago for a free trial of their Prime membership and while I liked it, I don't think I'd use it or its services enough to justify the cost so I had planned on cancelling it before my trial ran out... but I forgot to cancel in time! I noticed the charge to my bank account and called Amazon that day to say i didn't want the service and wanted a refund; I expected to have a huge fight about it but lo and behold, the first customer service rep I talked to took care of the charge right away as soon as I had explained my issue! No fuss and no fighting! That's the way a company with any sort of membership plans should be ran. A+ work Amazon!
amazon	Carmen5166	2014-06-27T20:05:38Z	5	I've never been disappointed with a shopping experience on Amazon.  I've ordered, books, music, and clothes seamlessly with fast delivery.
amazon	Sidsel Rastén Rydberg	2014-06-27T17:48:52Z	1	"I will never ever buy products at Amazon again. They are cheating there customers by drawing extra fees for ""memberships"" on your creditcard weeks after your order was placed and without notifying you!Fortunately I was aware of my bank statement, and after a complaint to customer service, I got the answer, that the fee will be refunded. Thus I give 1 star and not -5 stars!"
amazon	Jameal TechSavvy Lewzey	2014-06-25T02:16:51Z	5	I love shopping on amazon, they always have everything that I could possibly need!
amazon	mich	2014-06-24T22:22:26Z	5	I really love shopping at amazon. I am able to purchase a variety of items. I have recently expanded my music and TV show collection through this website. Also, I have bought food from Amazon. The customer service is great. I had an issue with one shipment and they fixed it for me.

amazon	Patrick Dreier	2014-06-13T04:16:17Z	4	I always get good and reliable service from amazon. Some of the sub-shops sometimes take long for delivery though.
amazon	james brown	2014-06-12T21:48:39Z	4	Very fast shipping. had problem only once in 2 years but they tried their best to resolve it. friendly and professional staff. keep up the good work.
amazon	Claus Hansen	2014-06-11T10:59:28Z	5	Great concept with the Prime! subscription. 1-2 days delivery almost everytime.Very convenient when living in Italy where shopping special goods requires a lot of time and search.Prices are always competitive and transparant.
amazon	Randy Lindsey	2014-06-06T18:49:40Z	5	I think that every company needs to learn from them they're literally the best when it comes to shipping time and quality of goods. I never hesitate to order on amazon because it never has left me unsatisfied so far.
amazon	Dr Anna Forrest	2014-05-31T14:31:32Z	5	What can you write about Amazon! Always the best
amazon	Ieva Slezaite	2014-05-21T07:49:21Z	4	Good service overall, I have always get product if ordered in amazon, while on other sites my products tend to disappear i mail system.
amazon	Andrea Mois	2014-05-12T17:47:33Z	3	i cannot believe my kindle doesn't read .docs . Otherwise it is a good product.
amazon	tracknfield003	2014-05-10T16:48:26Z	5	Very happy with the recent DVD promotions.  The live chat feature helped me know what I could order and the delivered products exceeded my expecatations.  Thank you!
amazon	Daniel Vesely	2014-05-09T06:21:35Z	3	I have been a Prime members since its introduction in 2005 and have been buying almost exclusively on Amazon and Myhabit. I never had a problem until Amazon started using USPS. Out of many USPS deliveries only one was delivered on time! Not only that - the Postal Service lies and claims that shipments were delivered a day or two before they actually are. USPS delivery people don't bother making few steps to check whether you are at home and leave notice so that you have to go to the post office to pick up the shipment. This makes Prime a frustrating experience. Teaming up with the USPS was a big mistake, and may end up costing Amazon in a big way.
amazon	Kaimana Bouska	2014-05-06T17:22:23Z	5	Amazon have very unique product at great prices. If you need something hard to find check with amazon and you would find it and at reasonable price. I love that amazon stand behind its sales so there's no risk in buying products from unknown vendors.
amazon	Lenny	2014-05-01T04:04:14Z	5	Amazon Prime is great! Everything I need is delivered to my door in 2 days with free shipping. And returns are easy.
amazon	Kelly Jones	2014-04-29T14:48:02Z	5	Amazon is my go-to spot for all of my books, especially since I use my Kindle quite often, but what I really love about it is I always find what I am looking for, sometimes for only .01!! Can't beat that price, lol. And there are a lot of free books for Kindle, I think of Amazon as my online book store, even though there is plenty of other things there!
amazon	Andrew	2014-04-29T00:03:13Z	5	Im a prime member and I could not ask for anything better. They started adding tax, kinda a bummer. They always have the best prices and trusted reviews.
amazon	Donald Henry Jr.	2014-04-27T01:58:39Z	5	you can buy almost anything on  amazon and they have great prices
amazon	Gretchen Brown	2014-04-23T05:21:51Z	5	Amazon is my go-to website for most of my shopping. Prices are competitive and so is shipping.  I love that they have one-stop shopping--you can get ANYTHING there.
amazon	Drusilla	2014-04-21T10:20:41Z	4	I've been shopping with amazon for over 6 years now, I think, and as for the quality of the products and packaging - there's nothing to complain about. Everything's been perfect in this respect. The site is easy to navigate and has provided 100% secure payment so far.I order a lot of books there - awesome choice, perfect qualityWhat I don't like are high UPS express shipping rates to Russia (but they do fulfill the delivery on time or sooner, I give them that) and some regional issues, where I cannot order certain stuff even for personal use, but that's the customs issue and import policies, I guess.
amazon	Gary Heller	2014-04-20T18:46:46Z	4	"I do much of my shopping and make most of my purchases on amazon.com.  Always had a good experience with it for many years. The Free Shipping used to be very quick but now takes several days, but that's not a complaint really. Options to have it ship quickly are always there and if you use Prime you can have it in two days on many products.There are many ""third party"" sellers on amazon now and you have to be a little careful with them and read their ratings to get an idea of what to expect from them. Prices are not always the lowest now so shop around, but service and website navigation is outstanding.Great place to shop online."
amazon	Roland	2014-04-18T20:39:34Z	5	Just received yet another product on time. Excellent service, fast delivery and competitive prices. Will continue to buy from them for a long time, especially with their Prime service.
amazon	Tim B	2014-04-14T08:30:10Z	5	Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy
amazon	Eric	2014-04-10T03:56:10Z	5	Has almost everything you need.  The price is almost always right as well. Very good for finding reviews and more info on products. Would recommend with confidence.
amazon	Stephanie Gray	2014-04-08T08:03:41Z	1	I can not believe that you have cut off so many customers in Portugal.  Making it unrealistic to order from your company.I hope that you are feeling the pinch but I doubt you will even notice.
amazon	Vlad Kozlov	2014-04-02T17:42:42Z	4	Great variety of products, too bad there are no coupons for Amazon
amazon	Michael	2014-03-30T23:31:00Z	3	"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!"
amazon	P. Brown	2014-03-25T19:37:45Z	5	i'm always happy with amazon they deliver quickly and all products are great quality.
amazon	Sarah	2014-03-24T17:42:48Z	4	I went through multiple exchanges only to be sent product that was DOA. They did refund the order after sending it back and eventually the postage since there was nothing of this specific product i ordered left. Would try again.
amazon	Susan Tremple	2014-03-20T19:57:52Z	5	So Amazon is something i use every day to every other day. Whether it's for used books to add to my library or shoes which are more expensive anywhere else...i am always impressed with their customer service and the speed of delivery. I use Amazon for food,  my pet's needs, for furniture....everything. I love it!
amazon	Mike Smith	2014-03-19T01:44:55Z	4	I buy and sell on Amazon I would give them a 5 start but they do try to control how much money you make in a month time.
amazon	travisz	2014-03-15T21:47:03Z	5	Love amazon, I try to buy everything I can from amazon.The only thing I don't like is the sales tax they started collecting in my state recently, :-(
amazon	Stefan Pioso	2014-03-15T17:02:50Z	5	Amazon.com usually has great prices and of course unbeatable selection.
amazon	jordan toms	2014-03-15T02:31:18Z	2	you just lost me...Free shipping is not real on amazon as the price is already backed into the item they are selling..I am done with Amazon...here I come Walmart!!
amazon	Alexa Dunnigan	2014-03-14T21:09:38Z	5	Amazon just makes shopping more enjoyable and life easier! I find nearly everything I ever need — from shoes to paper towels — and they are at my doorstep days later. And whenever (rarely) there have been any problems, their customer service is unbeatable. I fully trust and love the shopping experience, Amazon. Thank you!
amazon	Tam	2014-03-10T11:53:22Z	5	I buy stuff off Amazon all the time. I've never had any problem with them. They have the best customer rep and great policy. If you encounter any problem with your order: product does not meet description, package got lost, wrong item shipped, package got delayed, etc. They will take care of you right away and it's easy to get in touch with their customer rep. I've been ordering stuff from them for over 6 years now, from books to makeup to snacks. I have Amazon Prime - the free instant video and fast shipping service are just great! Totally worth the money. My friend always tell me I should be their brand ambassador because I always tell them how much I love Amazon lol.
amazon	Luiza	2014-03-03T20:33:18Z	5	Anytime I need anything I go to amazon. I have prime so I get fast free 2 day shipping. best deals for almost anything! must buy from here!!
amazon	iamcool	2014-03-03T19:19:17Z	3	It has become very obvious that Amazon intentionally delays their free shipping, probably so people upgrade shipping methods and pay more.  I just recently ordered something they have in stock sold from amazon, and was told it would ship from amazon a week(7days) later. What is up with that? Two days later I cancelled my amazon order, ordered from somewhere else(shipped same day), and still got my package delivered 3 days before amazon was to even ship it! You can read all about this on amazons own forum, hundreds of people wondering WHY amazon has become so slow past couple years.  All i can say is im not going to wait if better service is out there for basically same price, people will catch on, and go somewhere else, naturally.
amazon	Anonymous Client	2014-03-03T04:16:31Z	5	I guess I should. First, the site has whatever you desire to purchase. Second, the customer service is top notch. Third, when they mean two-day shipping they mean two-day shipping. I've been using this website to purchase things from gifts to food for years now. It's definitely worth your attention.
amazon	Mary Stephen Lou	2014-02-27T19:25:32Z	5	Every time I shop here, I know for a fact I'm getting what I order within an exact period of time, if not earlier. I love reading reviews on their website, so I always leave mine too. More importantly, I get to choose among different booksellers, second-hand books with various usage - love, love, love it!
amazon	Jen	2014-02-27T11:38:23Z	2	I have just purchased some items from amazon to be shipped to my overseas home, I used to think amazon was great for fast delivery however, my latest order has still to arrive and for love nor money I cannot get to an online section on the amazon site to cancel the order (I have given up waiting over 1 month for it to arrive).  Come on amazon - just because you have shipped something and passed it onto the post office doesn't mean your responsibility ends there.  It is very frustrating to wait this long for 1 item and to not be able to do anything about it except wait.  The message - be careful when shipping items outside US/UK as they pass items on to local post offices who are not always the quickest in the world - which is why we choose amazon to use someone like UPS or Fedex who will actually ship something on time!!  Cost saving in postage is a short term gain but not a long term gain for my repeated custom...
amazon	T Packer	2014-02-26T08:44:36Z	5	can't get enough! its amaz(on)ing!
amazon	C.DAANTJE	2014-02-25T17:37:54Z	5	"They understand the word service better than any other company on the internet.The ordered products arrive on time.Cancellations easy, even if the reason is ""I made a mistake.""When buying goods from another company, AMAZON give an assurance, in the event that the company is being difficult.BRITA I wrote earlier (BRITA leaks) was prepared after weeks to send a part of the bad product.Amazon took back the complete order,  they payed the return postage and refunded me the FULL amount!!AMAZON IS WORTH A PLATINUM LABEL.Its staff is very helpful and competent.A MODEL FOR ALL INTERNET COMPANIES."
amazon	Adrian Thompson	2014-02-24T08:08:52Z	5	Spot on delivery. Excellent customer care
amazon	Anita	2014-02-24T00:27:11Z	4	This is my first stop for all my needs. I've ordered baby supplies, toys, groceries, and things for myself from this site. I've definitely saved a lot of money. They are a company who usually honors their deals, as far as I know. I've also gotten things saying that they were delivered but were not received by me. Amazon has always given me refunds, without any suspicion. The only thing I don't like about it is now they have a lot of distracting ads for external websites.
amazon	Angela	2014-02-23T00:45:20Z	5	Amazon is the best retailer available on the internet. They have pretty much everything!! The shipping is fast and more often then not comes earlier than is expected. They have wonderful customer service on those rare occasions that you have a problem and are always doing what needs done to make it right. Will always check there first before looking anywhere else.
amazon	rcjank0	2014-02-22T12:40:37Z	5	I have been a prime member for several years now.  I live in Key West, FL and needless to say not much variety in shopping unless you drive 3+ hours to Miami.  Christmas, Birthdays, or simple needs I can one click and have my item here in two days (sometimes three.)  I don't really use all of the prime features, usually just the free 2 day shipping.  My kids use the free video service and they love it!  Good job Amazon, keep up the good work!
amazon	Judy Larusso	2014-02-19T12:15:55Z	5	I have been a satisfied amazon customer for years.  Delivery is fast, shipping rates are reasonable, and the quality of merchandise is excellent.
amazon	Eboni Campbell	2014-02-18T20:52:36Z	5	I have always used Amazon.com for just about anything. They have a large selection of items. Shipping has always been fast and I can just click and go. There was only one time that I needed customer service and when I spoke to the rep, the person was very knowledgeable, helpful and professional.Will definitely use them again!
amazon	John Amici	2014-02-18T16:09:19Z	4	fast delivery and reliable service
amazon	ayham  alnasser	2014-02-15T23:24:10Z	5	I Went to buy the XBox 360 amd it notifies for every step I LOVE IT.

amazon	xristofpap	2014-02-08T19:56:09Z	5	Amazon is a very important site for all people!!!!
amazon	Jenny Lima	2014-02-08T05:51:59Z	5	Shopping online used to scare me a lot. However since I've found Amazon I'm not scared anymore. They are the biggest online shopping portal ,the friendliest and the most easy to use. I use Amazon almost every week and their speed delivery option is simply fantastic. I once had a problem with my product and contacted the customer service department and was greeted by a customer service rep in less than 10 minutes. They solved my problem and was offered a brand new product which was delivered in a few days.
amazon	Aaron Hinzey	2014-02-07T20:50:29Z	5	Amazon is my favorite place to buy things. Their selection is huge and the prices are generally lower than normal, though if you like to shop around you might be able to find better deals at sales and such. Their customer service is excellent and as a seller on there as well, it is a great website to sell used things on. I don't think I've ever had a problem with them at all.
amazon	doreen	2014-02-07T10:46:16Z	5	Buying things online has never been made easier. With Amazon, trust me, you get all you need under one roof just by clicking. It does not matter where you are. There online service is just amazing. Try them and you will not be disappointed. You have a wow! service. I love amazon.
amazon	Jennifer Alston	2014-02-05T18:00:06Z	5	"I love Amazon. They have a nice selection of products. I broke a cell phone and had to replace the screen. I was able to order a replacement screen kit for under $10. Shipping time was a little longer than I would have hoped for, but I did receive my item. I was also amazed with the list of resources, when I was researching the kit, it had a list of ""How To"" videos. I found that very helpful."
amazon	viviann1	2014-02-04T18:47:35Z	1	I've spent thousands of dollars per year on Amazon, using it for everything from toilet paper to bed mattresses.  I purchased a lasser HP printer using my Prime Account, which worked poorly the first week, and completely quit working within a month. Amazon didn't note that the purchase was from a 3rd party company, who has refused to exchange the non-working printer because the request was made 31 days after the initial order (it took 2 weeks to arrive).  I've appealed this to Amazon's A-Z customer service, with no help whatsoever.  I've called, again nothing to offer.  I'm sure I'll still order from Amazon, as they are now the Walmart of  online shopping, but won't order except when I must.  So disappointed in Amazon!
amazon	Zoe Blaine	2014-02-04T04:12:41Z	5	I'm a college student, so I get free access to their Prime program, and I have to tell you it's been the best thing to happen for me and my organization. I just order everything online now and it shows up to my dorm in 2 days. This has been especially useful during this cold winter, where I barely even want to step out of my place. Definitely recommend Amazon and their prime service. Thanks!
amazon	Ramakrishna Garikipati	2014-02-02T10:53:14Z	5	the AMAZON is awesum .
amazon	Muralidhara	2014-02-02T10:26:38Z	5	Hello guys,I had a wonderful experience on my recent shopping. Prompt delivery and quality goods.Thanks Amazon :)
amazon	Eric	2014-01-29T17:51:48Z	5	I pretty much don't shop online anywhere else because even if it's a better price on another website, you can't beat free 2-day shipping.
amazon	Hannah	2014-01-29T17:17:33Z	5	Whenever I need to make any sort of online purchase, such as purchasing textbooks for class, Amazon is the way to go.  My dad has Amazon Prime, and I have Amazon student, and both of them offer free 2 day shipping on prime eligible items, and textbooks are very cheap with 2 day shipping. Just make sure your purchase is from amazon and not a seller on amazon, and you'll have quick delivery without any mishaps or issues. I recommend this site to everyone I know.
amazon	Liz Holdsworth	2014-01-27T15:22:00Z	5	Constant high service.Read as many articles on the Daily Mail about them as you like, but they deliver every time.They beat 99% of prices and the free postage is such a huge bonus.As an Amazon seller too - the service is easy and clear.
amazon	Abul Kalam	2014-01-26T21:56:36Z	5	super support and easy to use
amazon	Sturmbringer	2014-01-26T00:00:03Z	5	Stop searching for the world's best retailer, you found it! Good pricing, fast and easy to manage website, splendid customer service and never one fail in 14 years!As I live in Germany receiving the shipments takes a while. Out of hundreds of orders since then only one box got lost - Amazon instantly refunded the price. They even phone you in Germany if you want.It's a pleasure ordering from them!
amazon	Mathew	2014-01-23T15:52:51Z	5	The best of its class...! Wont find anything much easier and user friendly.

amazon	Joshua Smith	2014-01-22T09:57:52Z	5	I like to find all of my needs on this website, and I trust them when It comes to delivery and product satisfaction.I've ordered many times from Amazon, and will more in the future.
amazon	djshazz	2014-01-21T05:39:32Z	1	I sold an item on Amazon recently where the buyer claimed they ordered the wrong item.  Amazon quickly refunded the buyers entire purchase and told me that if I want the item back I have to pay for the return shipping, otherwise the buyer gets to keep it (FOR FREE).  What?  Are you serious?  Yep, my original cost on the item was $20. I listed it on Amazon for $17., after Amazon's fees ($6.00) and my reimbursement for shipping $4. even though it cost $10. (Yes, Amazon takes a cut on shipping too, even though they don't ship it.) I was to receive a total of $5. for the sale (Yes, lesson learned—I essentially lost $15. Not to mention my time and packing costs).  I’ve tried contacting Amazon’s sellers department via their 800 number only to have them tell me that they cannot help me and if I want a resolution I may only contact them via email.  REALLY?  I’ve tried contacting the seller support team via email three times now only to receive an automated response that leads me absolutely no where!  Wow, what a major disappointment, AMAZON you’ve cost me money and made plentiful amounts for yourself all the while ignoring the people that have made you what you are today.  A very, sincere disappointment!
amazon	Misty	2014-01-17T00:30:27Z	5	Amazon is so good about customer service and delivery.  (I love my Kindle Fire too.)This book is pretty amazing.  Another great resource for my husband and me to help with the good old IRS.  Over 40 years, we have only been audited twice.  The first time we were young and foolish in our business.  Now, we listened to the wrong people about our newly emptied nest and some investments we were told were deductions.  We knew it was too good to be true.  Hope this book helps.
amazon	CandySugar	2014-01-15T11:52:03Z	4	I had bought several cellphone cases. The delivery from Amazon is fast and with great packaging. They have very good prices. Best of all is the simplicity of ordering online.
amazon	Nour Tarek	2014-01-12T09:24:17Z	5	Amazon has the best customer care services between all the stores and online shopping websites I use. They're fast, and whenever you send emails or contact any of their representatives, they give you ALL the answers you need and on time. I just bought a pair of shoes and I was worried about the size because I found a review that said that the size came wrong, so I told them about it, and I got the correct size and they also sent an email asking about how it fit! I'm more than happy with my choice.
amazon	A B	2014-01-09T18:19:20Z	5	Always quality and cant fault them, belkin products i orders are cheaper than ordering direct! delivery this time was ridiculously fast for a free service also!
amazon	Anita	2014-01-09T14:26:28Z	5	Delivery was superb and fast, all books I ordered came in time. No trouble at all.
amazon	Jasmine Smith	2014-01-09T11:33:32Z	5	I just ordered my textbooks off Amazon, and am truly shocked at how fast they deliver! I can't wait to see their drones in the future (hopefully I won't still be ordering textbooks by the time those come out).
amazon	Wesley	2014-01-09T09:43:54Z	5	I've always had a noteworthy experience when dealing with Amazon. The company is very popular and there's a reason for that: they're dependable. Keep up the good work.
amazon	Walter	2014-01-03T03:03:45Z	5	When it comes to online shopping Amazon is easily the best. Quick deliveries, Hassel free transactions, great range of products makes it No 1 online shopping place.
amazon	Austin Sanders	2013-12-29T07:17:33Z	5	Ordered some Christmas gifts as I do every year. Delivery was fast within 2 days, which helped as I had ordered a little late. I received my order on the 24th, just in time for Christmas. Reliable as ever.
amazon	Michael Hughes	2013-12-28T21:32:44Z	5	Bought several presents in the days before Christmas. Was delivered at 8pm the day before, but they did keep their promise! I don't know how they do it!
amazon	Fast Eddie	2013-12-16T20:03:51Z	5	2 day shipping for free? low prices? hassle free returns?5 stars all the way
amazon	Sasha Feltzer	2013-12-13T05:46:05Z	5	90% of all my online shopping happens online. I love to shop with amazon. In fact, the Amazon app allows me to locate an item by scanning the bar code. This means when I am on the fence on whether I want to pay a price on an item, I scan it and know whether I can get it cheaper on Amazon. I am a prime member which is awesome. I get my items within 2 days of when I order, not from the time it ships which is awesome.
amazon	Darrin Cutting	2013-12-12T20:36:37Z	1	Ordered a ps game for my son for Christmas and received it in a transparent plastic package instead of the usual cardboard packaging. Inevitably my son saw it when it was delivered so surprise spoilt. To add injury to illness when I complained they basically said I should have chosen to pay to have it gift wrapped. Have Amazon now become too complacent with their customers?
amazon	Teddy Nugraha	2013-12-11T12:13:44Z	5	Simply one of the best online store on earth at the moment!
amazon	Tom Long	2013-12-04T22:50:47Z	5	Who doesn't?Drones coming soon...
amazon	Adam Smith	2013-12-02T16:17:02Z	5	Great service, delivered next day. Very impressed
amazon	brucem	2013-11-29T05:28:39Z	5	Cant got wrong with Amazon. I order from them frequently and they always are able to please!
amazon	Lori Lutz	2013-11-27T01:34:21Z	5	I started using Amazon when someone gave me a gift card for my birthday. I thought it was just for books but I was surprised to be able to get everything. I have bought boots, a telescope, and even health food products on there. I browse regularly to find great deals. Its truly a marketplace right at my fingertips. I feel like the website gives me the power to compare and shop wisely. The layout is very user friendly. The customer service is awesome and the shipping is on time according to when they tell me it will be shipped. I'm looking forward to doing most of my Christmas shopping this year via Amazon. It's much better that fighting the crowds and the deals I get are just as good if not better.
amazon	Melisa Hunton	2013-11-25T20:35:22Z	5	I think amazon is probably the best site on the web for book.well done.

amazon	Mandi Arileese	2013-11-16T18:01:49Z	5	Whenever I need something, I check Amazon first. I have only had an issue once with an item taking longer than what I was quoted and it was from a private seller who used DHL
amazon	Jonathan	2013-11-12T20:22:13Z	5	"Their customer service has gotten spotty the past few months, nothing serious, just ppl not knowing what they're talking about, they may have recently hired a bunch of new folks, hard to say.  But nonetheless, I've been treated with utmost respect every time I've purchased from them.  They have replied to every concern I've sent promptly (and I tend to ask a lot of questions!).  I've had a lot of marketplace sellers advertise products as ""like new"", and 9/10 of the time they aren't, but when I've felt undeniably let down by this form of deception, I've contacted the sellers as required, and 9/10 of the time, they treat me as respectfully as Amazon does, and as for the rest, Amazon has saved the day.  A couple sellers left bad tastes in my mouth.  I usually don't have enough dough to shop directly from Amazon's inventory, but when I have, I've noticed their delivery times are on par with the marketplace sellers', even when you factor in the 3-6 day delay they implement for free Super Save shipping (4 days to ship + 3 days for delivery).  All in all, these guys are good.  I feel safe with them, I will continue to buy from them."
amazon	Yehonathan Sharvit	2013-11-08T09:42:51Z	3	Very fast delivery
amazon	Walton Pat	2013-10-30T23:04:18Z	2	i received the wrong item in 2 separate orders from Amazon in the past 30 days. Get your act together and stop wasting my time with these returns and exchanges
amazon	Sam	2013-10-23T01:54:16Z	5	Do yourself a favor and sign up for amazon prime. Yes, you may be screwing over brick and mortar shops, but I love being able to order soap from my phone while in bed.
amazon	Nick Everitt	2013-10-21T17:04:25Z	5	Lost count of how many items I have bought from them over the last few years but they really do have this on-line sales malarkey cracked because I cant remember one bad experience with them.Deliveries are very reliable, items always come well packaged and price wise they are invariably the cheapest ... makes you feel sorry for the competition!
amazon	Victoria Gates	2013-10-17T17:30:58Z	4	I am in love with all the free movies and shows you get as an Amazon Prime customer in addition to the shipping savings. I have had a couple issues with their customer service but in all not enough to be terribly upsetting.
amazon	Jenna Richards	2013-10-15T07:32:37Z	5	What's not to like? Amazon.com is pretty much the best thing to happen to me since I moved out on my own. The prime shipping is a great perk, and the selection is bigger and cheaper than Costco. I may never shop in-store again...
amazon	Maia	2013-10-14T13:41:03Z	5	Great products, I'd like to get my stuff shipped to Denmark though. The UK and the DE sites, aren't as good as the US one.
amazon	Rob	2013-10-14T13:06:29Z	5	Have been shopping on amazon for about 13 years. They are still the best because I can return stuff that i don't like and they always refund me.
amazon	Carthy John	2013-10-13T14:00:21Z	5	I used it for a decade now..specially for e-books and music and only once had a minor issue with the delivery (it was national holiday which I  didn't counted in). Totally recommend it!
amazon	Zhi Zh	2013-10-11T23:31:35Z	5	It's no doubt that amazon has a very good reputation for their large product choice, competitive prices and efficient delivery system. They have the best delivery system i've experienced. So 100% confidence in shopping on amazon's site.
amazon	Jack Mallon	2013-10-10T16:48:58Z	5	I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and have never had a problem with them. Prices have increased a little over the years, but they're still my go-to choice because of how easy it is to order.
amazon	Dadogiag	2013-10-09T13:03:56Z	5	I am really happy with amazon! Everything I need (ok no food) I order at amazon! Music? Amazon! Sportsstuff? Amazon! DVD? Amazon! Best website ever! Belive me! It needs only a few days, sometimes only on day!!!! and you got it. I have no idea how they do it but they do it!
amazon	Tim Coleman	2013-10-03T14:59:29Z	5	I cannot find fault with Amazon, great selection, great price and when things go wrong they correct it so quick you forget that anything happened!

amazon	Hayley Fox	2013-09-16T14:29:36Z	5	Amazon is a great company, only issue I have ever found is when looking into things not sold by amazon themselves. I always pick the amazon prime products now
amazon	Laney Malee	2013-09-12T13:08:01Z	5	I love to shop online and I love getting the best price and Amazon offers this. I have to say that there have been a few times when they have not been the lowest, but it is rare. I love the free super saver shipping. The only negative thing I can say is that I downloaded the Amazon app for android and was looking at some items and accidentally hit the buy now button while scrolling. Just be aware that 1 click purchase is automatically turned on with this app. But I was actually planning to buy the item, it just freaked me out that all it took was scrolling down and touching the wrong thing.
amazon	Brendan Linebarger	2013-09-09T22:09:03Z	3	cheap and fast; they sure are. however they cant help me in the sales process; just undercut everyone else who can
amazon	Josh Kintzer	2013-08-31T22:52:41Z	2	On 2 separate occasions I had purchased an iphones from Amazon's Warehouse Deals (open box items) and they had sent me the wrong model; and both times the model they sent me in the box was much less expensive than the ones I ordered
amazon	Andrea Marsh	2013-08-30T11:36:12Z	5	Amazon.com is the BEST website ever.  I don't know why you wouldn't shop here.  You can buy everything and if you can't find it, you don't need it! You can get everything from groceries to engagement rings.  I love the low shipping prices and also if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can get 2-Day Free shipping.  I am a Kindle user so I use  Amazon to get all my books as well.
amazon	Therese Nilsson	2013-08-28T10:17:29Z	5	Amazon is a really easy way to shop and give good information about the shipment and what´s going on with my orders
amazon	Kevin Sorensen	2013-08-24T20:34:48Z	5	When I was living in China I often ordered items on Amazon's international website and delivery was always quick and customer service were always polite and helpful the few times we ran into trouble.
amazon	Chris Green	2013-08-24T13:11:05Z	4	It's great but I miss the super saver delivery on small orders under £10.00.
amazon	Carlos Gomez	2013-08-23T22:20:03Z	5	I've bought several times in amazon and it has allways beeb a good shopping experience
amazon	Alourenco	2013-08-19T15:16:31Z	5	Amazon is the best bet ever for any pockets. I love shopping at Amazon and things come well packaged and secured. Wonderful company.
amazon	Naif	2013-08-15T19:44:52Z	5	the best website ever, best prices, has almost everything & Great customer care! but it would be better if they offered international shipping on more products.
amazon	Joeyoung	2013-08-15T04:42:44Z	5	Excellent range of products, i have used many times and will certainly use again
amazon	Chrissi	2013-08-15T03:40:26Z	5	This is one of my favorite sites when it comes to shopping. They have great prices and free shipping on orders over $25 (with orders shipped thru amazon anyway). For instance, I found the battery for my laptop for $15 here though the retail price is almost $100.
amazon	BMF	2013-08-04T14:04:21Z	1	I used Amazon to buy books many years ago, never have any problem.  But when I start buying electronics from them, I have to find out the hard way that if it malfunction after one month while under warranty, Amazon don't care.  Go deal with the manufacturer yourself.  Recently I also start to sell on Amazon because of eBay fee hike, but it is quite a disappointment.  If you think 10% fee on eBay is bad, Amazon charges 15% plus 99cent per item if you don't fork out 40 buck a month for pro account, plus another $1.35 each if it is 'Media products'.  That's 26.7% for a 20 buck DVD!  Plus all the illiterate, ignorant, or downright retarded customers I came across on Amazon which I've never seen on eBay for the past 12 years.  But since they're there, I priced all my Amazon listings 15 to 50% more than my eBay listing to justify the hassle.Listing items on Amazon is also a beetch.  If your product doesn't have UPC or EAN, you will have to buy one or steal one from a soup can.Another note for people who cares about seller feedbacks.  9 out of 10 customers on eBay leave feedback because they want 1 back.  1 out of 3 customers on eCrater leave feedback because customer doesn't get feedback rating.  Only 1 out of 5 customers on Amazon leave feedback because they can read and write and their parents are not siblings.
amazon	Kylie	2013-08-02T05:28:28Z	5	I love Amazon. I subscribe to Amazon Prime and the two-day shipping saves me time after time. I don't depend on Amazon to always have the best price for everything--I am a researcher and I always shop around!--but Amazon almost always has the product I'm searching for. Instant Video is a plus, too!
amazon	Louie Palmer	2013-07-16T13:43:00Z	4	I sell on line and have for 13 years, all positive feed backs. I decided to use Amazon check-out. Big mistake when my client used it they held the money, it sold on July 2nd and I have yet to receive payment. The buyer has the item. They informed me that if I wanted payment quicker that I needed join some organization and get some kind of number for a fee of $229.00 to verify I am a legit seller . Truth be told Amazon most likely has stock in this company. There is nothing on Amazon about this, until you sell something of course. They only want big shoebox businesses not small merchants.I have tried to cancel my account and have no where to do it. I was able to delete my credit card info. Now I continually get messages to update my credit card info, FAT CHANCE. Avoid this merchant processing engine. Check out Ripoff site.Amazon has resolved the issue! It has changed my opinion.
amazon	Steve Lemon	2013-07-12T15:53:27Z	1	Recently bought a Kindle Fire HD from amazon.com as I was unable to order one from amazon.co.uk (for some reason, unless you live in the UK, amazon.co.uk don't want your business or your money when it comes to the Kindle, despite the fact that I live in another EU member state!).  The gadget was sent to me quickly from the USA and almost as soon as I received it,  I started to try to download apps to customize it to my specification.  However, I have now found out that because I do not live in the USA or have an American credit card, I am not even able to download some supposedly free apps!  Huh?  Surely the World Wide Web does what it says and is not supposed to be geographically  restricted by amazon - or anyone else for that matter!  Why was I not made aware of these restrictions before I bought and paid for my Kindle?  Turns out that I have paid a large amount of money (I had to pay extra tax because I ordered the Kindle from the USA!) for what is nothing more than a glorified e-reader.  What a waste of money!  I would have been much better off just buying books and using my PC for everything else....!Beware if you are considering buying a Kindle from Amazon as you may not be able to use it for anywhere near the amount of things you thought you would!It's a shame, too, as it's a great little gadget, but only if you can utilise it's full potential!
amazon	frankgod	2013-07-10T08:56:21Z	5	I have never have problems with them, orders always come on or ahead of time in perfect condition.
amazon	Houston buyer	2013-07-04T21:22:42Z	5	I probably do 90% of my online shopping there. They are all about customer service!
amazon	Atrade	2013-07-02T03:16:16Z	4	Best US website, High quality, But the price is a little high!!!
amazon	Gabriela Ortega	2013-06-21T07:45:43Z	5	I order nearly everything over amazon. The delivery is fast and the customer serve helped me alot as they responded very quickly.
amazon	Craig	2013-06-19T05:15:24Z	5	FAN-TAS-TIC service! It was a pleasure dealing with the guys at Amazone. Well packed, product exactly as described, best price ... would definitely do business again!!!
amazon	Alex Roberts	2013-06-17T15:29:54Z	4	Amazon generally is a great place to shop. I have had a couple of problems with my orders, ranging from the wrong item in the box to wrong quantities packed.Their customer service is pretty hassle free and pricing is usually one of the best
amazon	Catherine M	2013-06-12T21:45:54Z	5	Ordered a set of books as a gift, but book #5 was missing. They shipped a replacement set immediately. Awesomesauce
amazon	Dolly Ranger	2013-06-11T10:27:18Z	5	I ordered some products from Amazon, the choice of products were good,they arrived before estimated delivery date ,were well packaged,
amazon	Ross Garner	2013-05-25T00:34:23Z	4	I've used Amazon for many years and always enjoyed it. It's pretty easy to use and they always have what I'm looking for. I've had Amazon Prime for while now and it's always been worth it.
amazon	Pat Codispodi	2013-05-24T05:11:50Z	4	"Seems like the boys in shipping dozed off and put in two of the wrong books.  How does this happen in a company like this I don't know.  Actually, you know how ----->  HUMAN ERROR.  ""Can't we all just get along"" I once heard a wise man say... But honestly, I think we'll all get along together before we humans ever stop making mistakes!  So I forgiiiiiive you Amazonians. That's my story and I'm sticking to it ;)  Laugh if you got the cashgh, otherwise laugh anyways cause yo mama's a punk.Ps.   Can you believe I'm a judge!U can take the goof out of a twitface, but you can't take the twitface out of the goof.  Ain't that the truth!"
amazon	Bonnie	2013-05-16T18:46:32Z	5	I  purchase anything from shoes to electrical stuff at Amazon.com.  As a matter of fact I just placed an oder from them.  Before making a purchase I always look at reviews and shop around to find the best price.  Many times Amazon.com has the best price and the shipping is free.  Amazon has not steered me wrong.  I will always shop from there especially for books.
amazon	Antonio Margheriti	2013-05-13T13:27:44Z	1	"I ordered a Warbeast Guitar Hero Guitar, and the games Guitar Hero III and World Tour.I recieved products after only 4 days with an extra cost of 10 dollars, nice!Opened it like a kid on christmas eve cause i'm basically the biggest guitar hero fan ever, and what a disappointment!The coolest Guitar Hero controller ever made was already used, signed by some tard ""Danny Johnson 2009"", broken and worst of all, the USB hub which is needed to use the guitar wasn't there! WTF!?.Opened the rest of my recievings and the game Guitar Hero III packaging looked like some halfdehumanized african child who were beaten with a gigantic stick! I was like ""Nah"" thats okay, as long as the game works. It didn't. Some cheap chinese game which were not compatible with my other guitar hero controller. SHIT! All i was giving was shit including a perfectly working game (World Tour) Which didn't matter cause my day was fucking ruined so i shipped it all back. More trouble coming, as i demanded a refund. I was told: No problem, we'll refund the SHIT we gave to you. Including the shipping cost of 102 dollars which i paid. Only problem is, none of the refunds were refunded right (4 different refunds), so i have to continously ask them nicely to refund the money, cause they weren't refunded correct. I'm like wtf?! Worst personal consisting of 5 yrs old google translaters who don't know shit ever! i am NEVER shopping from Amazon again, and thanks to Amazon i don't trust ANY foreign stores. I'll stick up to the locals from now."
amazon	ialjasser	2013-05-07T13:06:26Z	2	Me our family have a dozen of products ordered from amazon. I have noticed lately the gap in the details of products provided. I am telling you this, if you are outside the United States, stay away from Amazon.Don't order shoes or consumer products. There is a dominant practice that they don't send you the same items as ordered. If you order a show, expect to receive different size that seems to be business as usual.aSaving was a waste of time and they just tell you how sorry they are with no real corrective action in terms of reimbursement or at least making the vendor comply with their product details.If you are an international online shopper, stay away from Amazon.cheers
amazon	Robert Floyd	2013-05-05T23:58:52Z	5	Fast and free shipping
amazon	Alexey Bizikin	2013-04-18T11:17:21Z	5	Excellent pricing, excellent service and quality.
amazon	Deena Sutton	2013-04-18T05:19:57Z	2	So i got that tripod from my new camera and was shocked how slow the shipping was. It took seller like 10 days to get it to me. I already had my lens, camera and bag in the house but that tripod from amazon was shipped like on 7th day. didnt like it. will shop on google next time
amazon	Mikkel Lund	2013-04-09T12:43:53Z	1	What might seem like a nice service is in fact charged at a whopping 4% premium at amazon.com. Most credit cards charge 1.5 to 2% - this is at least double.The concept is called Dynamic Currency Conversion and is entirely legal, however, it is a steep price to pay for doing the math for you. There is no limit to what the company can add onto the official exchange rate - the only rule is that they advice you of the actual exchange rate applied and the total added cost up front - which does not happen.Dear friends at Amazon, please stay honest - this isn't it ...
amazon	Brad Morehead	2013-04-04T21:14:39Z	5	Every order directly from Amazon is a great experience.
amazon	Jessica Tclt	2013-04-03T12:26:37Z	5	The US version, is like the FR version. They are both great, with good product.The only thing i could blame them is that not all of the product can be ship to France. I guess it's normal.But you can trust this website with closes eyes.
amazon	Jonathan Sluijters	2013-04-01T15:07:17Z	5	I recently purchased 5 items from Amazon.com, getting it shipped from the US to Denmark. I asked for as few shipments as possible, due to a 30$ import fee being added at the Danish boarder per package when the package is imported from outside EU. When they then shipped the items, it was split into to packages, and I contacted Amazon as soon as I received the email. One of the packages was already shipped, so unfortunately it couldn't be changed, but they gave me a 30$ refund for the extra import fee. As I was already positive about Amazon.com, since their prices are way lower then in Denmark, I have nothing bad to say about Amazon. Great prices, great service!
amazon	Don Lancaster	2013-03-19T20:54:25Z	5	Great Prices and Fast Shipping!
amazon	Pew Lemew	2013-02-21T19:40:55Z	2	apparently I am the prime target to get broken items from the sellers on amazon -_-
amazon	MarkOne707	2013-02-21T07:54:41Z	5	easy way to find what you want.
amazon	Tim Gilbert	2013-02-13T12:26:17Z	4	Found THE book i couldn't get anywhere else! Arrived within 14 days. Not bad considering distance. Lack of customer email address/number is a worry sometimes.
amazon	Stuff4Children.com	2013-02-13T07:32:27Z	4	Fast easy checkout system...definitely one of the best. checkout systems.
amazon	Sue Hall	2013-02-11T16:17:09Z	4	I use Amazon a lot to buy software, ebooks and MP3s.  The prices are hard to beat and their catalog is huge.  I still prefer bricks and mortar shopping for blu-ray and physical books because their shipping can be a bit slow and they have an annoying habit of splitting parcels even if you ask them not to. For downloads, though, I think Amazon has the best selection out there - and choices for DRM (steam/origin) too.
amazon	Samantha Andrus	2013-02-01T20:06:11Z	5	The first thing I should say about Amazon is that if you want a cheaper price for something that you want, then you should check here first. The next thing is that you can get free shipping on almost anything if you qualify for it (which is easy to do) They have everything and anything on the site. I would recommend this site to anyone and everyone!
amazon	Stephanie Wallis	2013-02-01T15:08:17Z	5	I order from amazon all of the time, and I have never had a single problem with them. Great items, great prices and free delivery!
amazon	Rachel Scholl	2013-01-31T19:41:21Z	5	Amazon proved their value to me when I had to buy textbooks for college.  Currently, I'm a new mom and we go through a lot of diapers around here.  I have searched high and low for the most affordable diaper and Amazon.com had the answer.  I have been more than satisfied with Luvs diapers.  They are cheap, and my little one hasn't had any type of rash or reaction to them.  The Subscribe and Save program works well because I get a shipment every month.  Best prices plus shipment right to my front door... I love Amazon!
amazon	Carl Adams	2013-01-26T17:16:54Z	4	"I use Amazon a lot for digital downloads, and while the prices are amazing, the delivery of digital products has been rather slow of late.  On three out of every four purchases I encounter the ""Processing this transaction is taking longer than expected"" message, and have to wait as long as four hours before the Steam or Origin code for my game appears in the software library. Still, I can't complain too much considering their bargain prices and the prompt availability of pre-order titles."
amazon	Debbie Selby	2013-01-25T22:00:37Z	5	I think i will try Amazon. the other reviews were mostly good, and the prices seem very reasonable.
amazon	Sam Jo	2013-01-23T17:13:53Z	4	When a price increased on a subscribe and save purchase without my knowledge or confirmation, Amazon was very studious in quoting their policy that they can increase prices without notice, but that they will refund the difference this time.  They had no problem assisting me and making me happy.  This was a very respectful means of communicating.
amazon	Zahid	2013-01-23T07:48:05Z	5	I bought a number of items during the holiday season, all arrived as described within 2 days despite being so close to Christmas

amazon	Charlene B.	2013-01-19T01:20:49Z	5	Love amazon period!
amazon	Michael Totu	2013-01-14T20:55:15Z	5	I have never have problems with them, orders always come on or ahead of time in perfect condition.
amazon	James Miller	2013-01-14T01:54:05Z	5	I'm actually a merchant myself, which makes me uniquely fit to evaluate others. I really like the way Amazon does business, and I have never had an issue with them after many years of shopping there. They are committed to fast shipments, and when I have had to return something, it has gone smoothly. Whenever I need something, I fire up my Amazon app and buy it in seconds.
amazon	Fly Emerica	2013-01-12T16:33:48Z	4	I'm sorry to say that because I love real bookshops. small and specialized where you can get great pieces of advice but...Amazon has everything you want, usually at a great price (remember it's also a second-hand book... mall). reviews can be trusted if you know how to read them and if you use other websites to get a more specific idea of what you'll get and customer service is really good.one con though : very often, books are delivered damaged (because postal service is kind of garbage in my country:) and getting a refund is a bit annoying (you have to print out a piece of paper, stick it to the parcel...). but it works.just NEVER buy 10 or 20 books at once, they will all be damaged because Amazon doesn't protective enough large cardboard boxes. no problem with smaller quantities.the world has changed, probably not for the better as small business is slowly dying out but in this new desocialized world of business, Amazon is one of the best.
amazon	Vladimir Levitin	2013-01-11T17:12:27Z	5	Nice company,very caring and helpful staff
amazon	Andy Nguyen	2013-01-05T04:22:31Z	5	"I like this place as a consumer. They even give you a free one month trial membership; it means that Amazon will give you free fast shipping for a month, just make sure to cancel the membership later by clicking the ""do not upgrade"" button on the Amazon Prime page or you'll have to pay after the trial is over."
amazon	Rand J Csehy	2012-12-26T05:17:03Z	1	"Absolutely the worst experience ever!  After charging me $25 for ""guaranteed"" delivery by December 22, I was notified by FedEx that Amazon requested ""regular delivery"" and my son's 'big present' would be delivered on the 26th or thereafter. When I contacted customer service at Amazon, I was told to tell my 4 year old ""look on the bright side...Xmas goes an extra day"".  Unfortunately,  at 4 years old, my son has developed the essential skills to be a pragmatist and Amazon- I will see to it he never becomes one of your customers. Bah Humbug to you and yours!"
amazon	Gary Cox	2012-12-19T23:56:38Z	5	Always quick and easy to use. The best variety on the net.

amazon	Paul Sheffield	2012-12-10T02:44:29Z	5	I live in the UK, but on a visit to the US I brought a rather expensive keyboard which on return to the UK I inspected the keybaord and found the US keyboard layout was different to the standard UK keyboard layout.  D'oh the mistake was my fault I should have checked the keyboard immediately on receipt, as should be done with all mail order goods.I looked to send the keyboard back from the UK to the US but the cost was too much.  Two months went by with the unused keyboard sitting in the box, (with me very much considering putting it on eBay), when found that I was taking a trip back to the states in  a couple of weeks.I wasn't really expecting the Amazon.com to do anything, after all I was well outside the the return time frame of 30 days, but I'd thought I'd ask.To my sheer delight customer service got back to me saying that they would accept this late return, providing it was unused and new (of course).I'm delighted with this amazing good natured and helpful customer service, willing to bend the rules for me.Thanks Amazon.com.  BTW Amazon.co.uk rocks to!
amazon	Linda Tran	2012-11-29T03:38:52Z	5	I use Amazon.com when I'm shopping for prices on almost anything. If I'm searching for a good deal on a specific product, I compare prices on Amazon.com against other sources, and most of the time, Amazon.com offers it at a lower price and free shipping. I never have a problem adding stuff to my cart for the free shipping option, $25 on Amazon.com is a breeze! I've purchased kitchen stuff, electronics, pet supplies, and other random stuff. The user reviews are extremely helpful when I'm comparing products. Sometimes I use Amazon.com user reviews when I'm shopping at other stores or websites to gauge if it's worth buying. The only negative point I have about Amazon.com is the clutter on their website. It's pretty overwhelming when they have tons of products and the website has a lot going on. It's not a big problem for me though since I'm usually looking for something specific.
amazon	Judy	2012-11-26T18:44:37Z	5	I love Amazon! I have bought perfumes, makeup, furniture, linens, cat toys and collars, cat trees, cell phone accessories, my KINDLE! baby toys, books....the list goes on and on. Amazon is simply the best online shopping experience ever. I usually only buy from them-because they have excellent customer service. On the off chance that I buy from someone on Amazon and they screw up and don't respond-Amazon has taken care of that and done so in a timely fashion, too. This has only happened a few times, though-for the most part all of my purchases have been worry free and free super saver shipping rocks too!The only thing I would change is their constantly emailing me with suggestions and 'bargains' which is unnecessary. I check in at least once a week to look at things I am interested in--I really hate this invasion of my privacy and this intrusive bossiness--not enough to knock off a star--because I do love you just that much, but it's enough to warn you that I will stop shopping with you if you don't stop bugging people in this fashion. Come on, you're AMAZON--a household name. Stop shilling, stick to the easy website design, great products, excellent customer service and just stop with all the blaring, glaring spamming, ok?
amazon	Kim Daoust	2012-11-19T17:29:45Z	5	Amazon.com's Prime is a valuable asset to my home and business. I can sometimes find pricing on Prime that I can't in the wholesale marketplace. 2nd day air shipping on this items makes their value unbeatable for certain things. I am all about convenience and great service!
amazon	Ricky Stephens	2012-11-16T17:48:34Z	5	I use amazon.com for nearly all my online shopping! Even if I can't find everything I'm looking for directly on the site, it is a great starting point.
amazon	Benjamin Skinner	2012-11-12T22:52:10Z	5	Whenever I need to buy something I always head to the Amazon marketplace first because they have a huge selection of items to pick from and they are usually cheaper than what you would pay at the store. Other than being affordable you can see which items are actually high quality because of the reviews that other users leave for them, which I always pay attention to.  I also love the fact that I get all of my items in two days thanks to prime and I never have to worry about shipping costs. I do usually avoid furniture and other bulky items from Amazon because there is usually a shipping cost and it's normally pretty high.**Update July 2015Since writing my original review I can happily say that I've purchased a night stand, a large sewing table, a Futon Frame, a few mattresses and a bunch of other bulky items from Amazon. With my prime membership shipping was free on each of these items and the price of them beat out every other option available. It's hard to beat that, especially when you add in how fast Prime shipping is.
amazon	Sarra Jackson	2012-11-10T02:07:19Z	5	I'm a huge Amazon customer. I'm a prime member and take full advantage of it. I love how reliable they are for shipping items out and the wide selection of things they have. The times I have gone to a brick and mortar store, like Walmart or Target, if they don't have have an item I need I'll search Amazon on my phone and there's been a few times where they have it and it's also cheaper along with free shipping. I've had to use their customer service when I had a problem with my Kindle and they got it figured out really quickly.
amazon	Chris	2012-11-08T10:57:07Z	5	Always Reliable Service
amazon	Robert Brighton	2012-11-08T00:48:09Z	3	I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program. I had the EXACT book as the website (Same ISB #, same edition, etc.), and they sent it back to me saying it wasn't the right book. A little upset with the whole experience, but I still like Amazon overall.
amazon	Lesley Harrison	2012-11-06T23:05:37Z	4	I rarely buy books on amazon these days (my local book store is better value for all but the hardest to find titles), but I love it for odd gifts, executive toys, and even food items that are hard to find where I live.  I just wish the delivery estimates were more accurate.
amazon	Kristie Lorette	2012-11-06T22:20:09Z	5	I order a lot of books for my business. I love to shop on Amazon because I can find the books I need and search by price, so that I can find the book at rock bottom prices. I also find it extremely helpful that Amazon includes pretty extensive details about the book, such as the number of pages, a description, all of the sellers that offer the book (new and used), and even supplies reviews from users like me, all on one page.
amazon	Ddan Rafter	2012-11-06T20:40:44Z	4	The prices on Amazon are never lower than they are at my local retailers, especially when it comes to toys and books. But shopping on Amazon is certainly more convenient. You can always find what you want and have it delivered straight to your home. That's worth the extra few dollars in my opinion.
amazon	Victoria Colewood	2012-11-06T01:55:18Z	3	Although I have been happy with Amazon's service and prompt delivery I noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes, as most fur is imported from China and former Soviet States with animals skinned alive, electrocuted and very much abused I do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site, please consider an ethical overhaul of some product lines
amazon	Megan Odell MacSparran	2012-11-03T17:27:11Z	4	I buy from Amazon.com because it is so convenient. I get everything from food to clothes to horse tack to movies, all in one purchase. I love their free shipping when you spend enough (on a lot of my purchases anyway) and I always seem to be able to find things I can't find elsewhere. My only complaint is related to the shipping times. Sometimes the arrival days they present aren't true and things arrive a day or two later. Sometimes I don't mind and other times it really matters, such as when my nephew's birthday present arrived late, so I'd love for that to be more accurate. I'd pay to ship in certain circumstances. And yes, I know they have the Prime option but it doesn't apply to all purchases and for the ones it does apply for, I can usually swing free shipping anyway. Overall, I'll definitely keep buying from them.
amazon	Robert Bishop	2012-11-02T23:47:29Z	5	I have only admiration for them, as with Google, I'd never heard of Amazon until 13 years ago! I can see why they have done well. I have had no issue ordering from them. There service is spot on, quick, the packaging is good. Some prices could be cheaper, but that is splitting hairs!
amazon	Foteini Horbou	2012-10-25T15:59:55Z	4	I buy from Amazon the last year and i'm very satisfied by it's products. My only problem is that some of its products can't be sent in European countries and invoice is not in pdf format. I suppose they assume that everybody in this world is an owner of a printer. I also have to add that Amazon.com is way better than Amazon.co.uk in all fields. I will buy again very shortly.
amazon	Benjamin Coulson	2012-10-22T21:39:11Z	5	"The header kind of says it all.  What more needs to be said about the online behemoth known as ""Amazon.com?""  It's huge, which means it has a wonderful selection, but despite their size I've had nothing but good experiences with their customer service department.  Sometimes, the subsidiary companies that Amazon works with can be a pain, but in the end Amazon itself has always done right by me.  I appreciate them having everything I'd ever need and usually at a much better price that real life, in person stores."
amazon	Scott Mishler	2012-10-20T22:27:11Z	5	I have never had any problems with either buying or selling anything on Amazon. I bought my wife a 2nd gen Kindle a few years ago for Christmas and it broke within a few weeks. She called Amazon, spoke to them and within 2 days received a new one. My brother in law spilled water on his Kindle and was upset. I told him to call amazon and lo and behold they replaced it! Honestly can't say anything negative about them. They have a loyal customer here.
amazon	Leslie Barker	2012-10-08T18:13:25Z	5	I shop on Amazon for tons of things.  Often they include baby items, books, shoes, toys, plant seeds and more. With a Prime account (totally worth the small cost) I have free 2 day shipping (or overnight/1 day shipping for like $2.99) if it ships from Amazon.  Their returns are easy and their return policy is very forgiving.  While I do like to buy local, sometimes it's just too easy to buy from Amazon because it's cheaper and comes with free delivery and easy returns if needed.  I buy a lot during Christmas too given the crazy shoppers in the malls etc...  ;-)
amazon	Janelle Nordstrom Hamm	2012-10-06T18:32:59Z	5	I love Amazon.com! Not only do they have the price to beat but they sell everything!!! I have had nothing but good experiences when purchasing from them. When there was a problem they fixed it! I recommend it to anyone!
amazon	Michelle Taylor	2012-10-01T02:37:54Z	5	I've found so many items on Amazon that I needed and wanted, it's literally the best online shopping venue around, and their shipping is INSANELY fast! And when you have Amazon Prime (Which is only $39 for a student like me), you get FREE two-day shipping, and the membership pays for it eself if you do as much online shopping as I do.
amazon	Jennifer Anderson Lee	2012-09-19T16:21:56Z	5	This is one of the best online stores ever. No question on refunds- I just told them I was not satisfied with the blu-ray quality of a movie I purchased and they provided full refund and free return.
amazon	Sam Merlot	2012-09-16T07:06:52Z	5	Amazon is amazing you can get anything you want here.

Every time I walk into a electronic store I double check to see if Amazon has a better price and they usually do. I even bought a $2 mouse pad from Amazon the other day. Free Shipping & No Tax, straight to my door in 2 days. Can't get easier and cheaper then that!
amazon	Sarah Newport	2012-09-14T17:20:09Z	5	I don't know where to start... ordered hundreds of things over the last few years and everything is always on time whether I order directly from them or through the online sellers.i HEART amazon!!! :-)
amazon	Rghrdhdrhdh Hdrhdrhrthrh	2012-09-14T15:22:13Z	1	Does not protect sellers again scammers who want free products and money. They allow them to tell lies about sellers without any recourse!!!
amazon	Knud Røgilds	2012-09-13T11:02:29Z	5	I shop for Kindle stuff, the shipping of other good is to expensive and here I use the UK site.

amazon	TJ	2012-09-04T13:39:38Z	5	I always used to use amazon before I got ebay, then I moved over. However, after doing much online shopping on ebay I have noticed that even over all the great amazing deals on there, Amazon gives the most amazing deals and reasonable prices anyone could ask for on their products.It's an amazing website that I would definitely recommend to a friend. Very easy to use, even for people who aren't always 100% sure on how to use a laptop, it is still simple to use.

They finally get the refund right, only now, they send totally different parts that I never ordered, in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order. At least they did not ship me an assault rifle like they did to someone in DC.

amazon	Sharon Brunson	2012-07-14T21:03:14Z	5	Amazon.com was the first place I ever made an online purchase, and it's still my go-to store.  Some of the pros are dependability, selection, and economy.  I love all the reviews that customers post, so I really know what the product is.  I have used Amazon for shoes and clothing, jewelry and watches, kitchen gadgets and appliance, books, music, and more.  Returns are super easy when I order the wrong size, and customer service has been very helpful on the few occaions that I have needed them.

amazon	Beth	2012-07-14T12:08:26Z	4	Amazon's prices are very competitive and their free delivery is super, so I use the site a lot. However I do find the website quite confusing as there's text and images everywhere. I also get a few too many emails from them but that could be sorted out really. I do find it quite hard to navigate if you want to browse but if you know what particular item you want it's easy to search and find it. I will continue to use Amazon for their great range of products and fab prices.

amazon	Robert L. Simione II	2012-07-11T21:35:54Z	5	I buy anything I can from Amazon for a few reasons:1. Good reviews that allow me to find the good quality reasonable cost products (and avoid the bad ones). 2. Speedy delivery to my door at a reasonable price. (Now I use Amazon Prime, which is even more reason to go to amazon.com).3. They have a great returns policy. Namely, they make it quite easy to return a product should something go wrong. Most stores you can show up to the store with a receipt and you have to twist their arm for a refund. With Amazon I just print the return shipping label, put it on the box they send me, and drop it in a UPS box somewhere.
amazon	Jan Nieman	2012-07-11T21:26:16Z	5	Have ordered from here for many years and will continue to do so.  Quality products and quality service.

amazon	Steve Chadwick	2012-07-11T20:53:57Z	3	The site provides a huge selection and prices are usually competitive.  Main gripes are that six items can result in 6 different deliveries - my street is like the M6 full of delivery vans after every order.Big plus is that Amazon are very helpful when things go wrong and help resolve the issues quickly
amazon	BlueArmada	2012-07-11T19:41:58Z	4	I find that you need to compare prices before you buy. Also sometimes the items arrive in less than perfect condition and are slow delivery.
amazon	Susanna  Beer	2012-07-11T18:25:22Z	5	I am very  happy with my Amazon account, which has made a real difference to my life. The transactions are smooth and speedy and if I have a query I can phone up and receive courteous and helpful advice.

amazon	Lluis Massip	2012-07-10T18:48:44Z	5	I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!
amazon	Jane Pritchard	2012-07-10T17:42:08Z	5	I have purchased several times from Amazon and found them to be a good company to deal with. Their prices, delivery charges etc are fair and they cover a whole range of products. I would recommend them.

After dozens of transactions, I had two bad experiences with Amazon suppliers in the same week. Amazon's customer service was perfect. They resolved the problems fast - and at great expense to Amazon. I am a ""raving fan"" as a result."

I find the service very easy to use, well laid out and appealing.  The site usually offers interesting alternative books which other people with similar taste have looked at our bought.  When I want a treat I buy myself a book(s) on Amazon, simple!

Even when using the Amazon market, the retailers have always been good to deal with.On the occasions when the items had to be returned the customer service and refund policy is great!
amazon	Philip B	2012-07-04T22:25:35Z	5	Every retailer, whether online or physical store should pattern  themselves after Amazon.com. I am a frequent customer of Amazon's , Have been for a few years,and I have yet to have anything but minor problems which their excellent customer service has always taken care of right away. While they might not always be the cheapest, I think their customer service more than makes up for that, since a lot of times cheap, also means cheap customer service.You can't do wrong buying from Amazon because I know it works for me, and they can work for you too.
amazon	Gary Siegalkoff	2012-07-04T20:41:57Z	5	can count on Amazon for the products at the best prices.
amazon	L. Davis	2012-07-04T13:29:30Z	5	I absolutely LOVE AMAZON!! I have been a customer with them for years and I use them at least 2-3 times monthly. They have an excellent return policy that's very customer friendly and they really are a company that prides themselves on customer satisfaction. My orders are always rec'd timely and in a high quality manner I highly recommend Amazon. You won't be dissatisfied.
amazon	Vi Nguyen	2012-07-04T13:22:04Z	5	Amazon is definitely one of my favorite online shopping sites besides of course, ebay. However, I prefer amazon more. The reason being is, Amazon does not scam. I can give 100% trust in the service & the seller. Although sometimes, apparently, it does not carry what I wanted therefore I have to switch to ebay. But overall, I'd always pick Amazon because it has never failed me! :)
amazon	SEB	2012-07-04T11:12:46Z	5	Never once had a negative experience with this company.  Website great, plenty of choice, and delivery has always been on time.  Would recommend this company to everyone.

amazon	Laura Conklin	2012-07-04T02:01:45Z	5	I have purchased many things through Amazon over the course of several years. They carry hard-to-find merchandise, at reasonable prices. Frequently their prices beat what I can get locally as well. Customer service has always been excellent, and my products have almost always shipped immediately. The few times that I have been dissatisfied with what I received, exchanging the item was simple and hassle-free. Amazon.com has become my family's go-to source to get almost everything short of perishable groceries. (They do sell those, too...I just get them at my local grocer.) Especially like the wish list feature, so I know that I am getting someone something that they really want.
amazon	Lisa Novak	2012-07-03T22:00:02Z	5	I always check Amazon first before going anywhere else.  Great deals and free shipping on most items!

amazon	Monica Macdonald	2012-07-02T23:52:15Z	5	When looking for any online product I always purchase through Amazon as guaranteed best online price and delivery is super quick and normally free. But also gives advantage of 1 day delivery, if required, with additional charge.
amazon	Richard Van Leuven	2012-07-02T20:14:43Z	5	What can be said about Amazon! that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? Probably nothing, but they are number one for a reason. Price, selection and service are all excellent, you really don't have a reason to shop elsewhere!
amazon	Lizziebobs	2012-07-02T19:39:21Z	5	Being a student I Like to keep the costs down on moset items and I have ALWAYS found the academic books I need from  Amazon.  I prefer to purchase my books rather than borrow from the library.  Brilliant site for all my reading material.I have also purchased various other items from Amazon and rarely have a problem, on the odd occasion that I have they have dealt with my queries promptly and satisfactory.
amazon	Nat, the pet's human and care giver	2012-07-02T18:29:55Z	1	I can't combine shipping.  I was going to buy from a merchant and he couldn't combine shipping.  Shipping was going to be over $100, the items could all fit into the same box.
amazon	David Bond	2012-07-02T13:48:50Z	2	Firstly I must say that I've found Amazon to be mostly reliable, but Ooooh when they get something wrong... I recently pre-ordered a videogame from them and when it had failed to arrive by the Monday after release I phoned contacted them, only to hear that I'd have to wait the usual (11?) working days before reporting it lost. Nothing arrived so I complained again, and a replacement was finally sent. In the meantime, because it was a birthday gift, I had to buy a second copy elsewhere (from shopto.net incidentally) which was ordered at 7pm on the Monday and arrived the NEXT morning! FIVE days after the original 11-day wait the replacement arrived from Amazon, and then, a week later what I could only presume was the original order arrived, post dated well after it should have been shipped (it was a pre-order remember?), but before the replacement was posted. This of course I returned which was a simpleprocess that cost me nothing extra but was an unwanted hassle nonetheless.So WHERE had it been? WHY wasn't it posted First Class as I paid for (the time it took to get here I imagine it was sent by Airmail-pigeon post), and WHY couldn't it be tracked? SHOULD this review be on Royal Mails' site? I DON'T KNOW the answers to any of these questions, but I do know that I won't be using Amazon again anytime soon for videogames, no matter what tempting pre-order bonuses they offer.
amazon	Mary Ellen Bunyan	2012-07-02T13:05:18Z	4	Love to buy from amazon and have got many things cheaper than on the high street. The only draw back is that product descriptions can sketchy to non existent sometimes and i have had to look up the product else where to get proper information then buy it on amazon. That said they have often been the best priced for items on the net. I have braught many e-books on amazon and find that the selection offered is amazing, but again the product information is very hit and miss. I would prefer a page count or word count as to pay pounds for a 10 page short story is not my idea of value. I have looked at health remedies on amazon but the lack of information has stopped me buying, no in grediets list or stregnth  levels for the product i looked up.
amazon	Mr Mark Brimble	2012-07-02T10:24:32Z	5	I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.

amazon	Dave Goff	2012-06-30T17:49:12Z	1	I ordered a Xbox game that never arrived after 2 emails i reported the problem to amazon. I got an email from amazon that they will look into it. 2 weeks later i was offered credit instantly or i would have to wait upto 4 or 6 weeks for my money back.  I also have a serious problem with delivery charges and many times felt ripped off. If i can i will go elsewhere before going to amazon. Amazon only gets my orders if i cannot get the item i want anywhere else
amazon	Barbara Esmedina	2012-06-30T17:03:20Z	5	Favorite place to shop. Buy everything here. Love the prime membership! Outstanding Customer Service. In all the years I have shopped Amazon, never a single bad experience. Favorite product is the Kindle. I have upgraded everytime they do a new model and use the old ones to loan to friends when they travel. Bought one years ago for my book-loving 80 year old mother, she couldn't live without her Kindle.

And prices on the site are keen.

amazon	LJ	2012-06-27T18:02:32Z	5	A great range of products and nearly always the cheapest too. Mostly delivered before the estimated date.
amazon	Tyler Gaymer	2012-06-27T14:55:07Z	3	Every time I order I'm left with tons of Packaging to dispose of!Their super saver delivery service has significantly slowed down since I first started shopping with them. Pricing is good on the whole but often find stuff cheaper elsewhere and recently sent price notice for a microwave that was £30 cheaper on another site (with free next day delivery!) but got no response.Obviously I bought it from the other retailer but would have preferred Amazon due to their easy return process.
amazon	Simran	2012-06-27T10:36:25Z	5	ALWAYS ORDERING ITEMS FROM HERE. DELIVERY AND ACCESSIBILITY MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER.VERY CONVENIENT.

amazon	Trevor Fletcher	2012-06-27T01:44:30Z	4	Amazon.com is a really great site, it supplies items at competitive prices and provides a great service, if only Amazon.co.uk could match the prices, sadly we seem to pay a lot more for the same item just because Amazon can get away with it. The service is still good but the corporate greed spoils it.
amazon	Maddi	2012-06-27T01:21:56Z	5	Great variety, great shipping, never had a problem that I didn't cause myself (haha).  This site is the FIRST site I go to for just about everything.

amazon	Robert Douds	2012-06-26T18:14:52Z	5	Amazon has EVERYTHING ! Well at least it seems like it does and if they don't have it you can look for it on another website and add it to your Amazon Wish List and keep track of alll your items you are planning to purchase over time or also allow your family and friends know how to shop for you holidays and special occassions. Our entire family uses Amazon's Wish List browser button and it sure makes shoppping so much easier.You Go Amazon...You Rule !!!

Fantastic range of products; from buying bargain books several years ago, Amazon is now my first port of call for just about everything - they rarely let me down for choice or competitive price.  If I need to replace my car in the near future  . . . . .

amazon	harrybradley	2012-06-25T13:09:58Z	5	You can return your order for free (not always if you do not buy direct from Amazon). Customer service replies almost straight away. Prices are often the lowest on the internet. Free delivery on all Amazon Fulfilled orders. There really is nothing negative to say. Apart from the odd delivery let-down - but usually that's the delivery company's fault.

amazon	R H Williams	2012-06-24T12:16:12Z	1	Why pay extra for a guaranteed delivery time they sold you on when they  don't deliver and only tell you after the money has come out that is was estimated and not, infact, as they promised, guaranteed.Another typical lie to steal money.

amazon	Crescentia Cook	2012-06-21T16:02:14Z	5	Easy to search for products. Product reviews really helpful.  Have never had a problem buying from the site.
amazon	Deborah Peach	2012-06-20T21:47:24Z	4	my only bug bear is that the postal costs are sometimes hidden away when you an item that is not sold directly from amazon. soemtimes it can be difficult to work out what you are paying for. there have been times i have thought about buying something only to discover the postal charges were astronomically high in comparison to the cost of the item. I think amazon should rectify this situation where the traders make the product price very low  ie 1p and then build the true cost of the product into the postage costs, so you never really know how much the item costs.
amazon	Alex Richardson	2012-06-20T18:08:19Z	5	I have just ordered an external hardrive on Amazon, it took about 3 minutes having spent about 40 minutes trying to checkout on Curry's/pcworld. What a good speedy service, I should have come to Amazon first.

amazon	Jeanne Glickert	2012-06-17T20:54:31Z	5	I've never been disappointed when using Amazon.com.  They stand behind their products and products of outside sellers thru them.  You can't go wrong using AMAZON.COM.
amazon	Michael Cone	2012-06-17T20:16:55Z	4	The overall Amazon store experience is very good.  First, I can purchase nearly anything on Amazon at decent prices.  Second, I can read reviews of the products before purchasing.  Third, I can usually compare many different competing brands - which helps me to gauge the quality of what I am purchasing.

With the Markeplace guarantee, you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter. Comforting when ordering from around the world. I rely on Amazon for household goods, electronics, camera equipment, shoes and clothing, books, and entertainment, everything but husband.

amazon	Laura Hume	2012-06-11T01:18:28Z	5	I love shopping on here as they have everything and at the fraction of the price compared to the high street.
amazon	Lorna	2012-06-10T21:18:47Z	5	Sometimes not the cheapest but Amazon never fails to have excellent products at excellent prices.  I love the fact that when you buy directly from them and the product is not to your satisfaction you can send it back for free.  I made the mistake of buying Dr. Marten boots from ebay instead of Amazon and because they were too big had to pay a whopping £7.50 to return them.  I was gutted and vowed never to buy shoes from ebay again!  Amazon all the way!
amazon	Avril Thomson	2012-06-10T08:39:45Z	5	Every item that I order is just as described, receive in record time, and mostly if not always are free delivery, you can not beat that!!

amazon	Kim	2012-06-09T02:57:33Z	4	Allows me to save a lot, but I end up spending a lot too.  Subscribe and save is so addicting.  At the same time, some products are cheaper in the store, so definitely price compare.  Their deliver is pretty good though
amazon	Linda  Birbeck	2012-06-09T01:14:27Z	5	I have bought endless birthday and christmas presents from Amazon, and they have always arrived in good time.

amazon	Peter	2012-06-04T14:18:29Z	5	I have an Amazon credit card which gives me dollars towards my purchases on Amazon. This in combination with competitive pricing and great product selection makes it great to purchase at Amazon.
amazon	Andy Watkins	2012-06-04T11:55:04Z	1	"I have always dealt with Amazon have spent thousands of pounds with them and would have given them 5 stars but for a recent transaction which I found totally unacceptable.I ordered a product off of their ""main page"" not the marketplace, but it turned out it was coming from an associated trader who was shipping the product from the USA. I became suspicious as soon as i placed the order and tried to cancel it. Both Amazon and the supplier said I was not allowed to cancel the order 5 minutes after I placed it even though It was not despatched for 3 days. When it arrived (illegally bypassing customs by incorrectly labelling the contents) I returned it it and they refunded me the purchase price. NOT the £8 it cost me to return it. Amazon customer services used a number of extremely bad practises to avoid speaking to me, I would STILL like to speak to a senior Amazon representative to explain exactly what happened. I am an auditor by profession and am appalled by some of the practices I encountered at Amazon.  I am now EXTREMELY careful what I order from Amazon"
amazon	Georgia Hunter	2012-06-04T03:29:58Z	5	I find almost everything I need from them, my account is set up, I buy with one click. Done deal. Love the service, no hassles !

amazon	Rejean Paquet	2012-06-01T23:08:46Z	5	I have been an Amazon customer for many years, I have been a PRIME member for the last 4 years. I enjoy shopping on Amazon, you can find ANYTHING you want, I'm amazed at the large selection of products that you can find. The prices are always competitive, most of the time the best price around the internet. No tax for me in FL plus Free shipping with Prime membership. Prime membership gives you access to movies. Plus the free space in the cloud, the Amazon player, the electronic download for software, very very convenient.  For more savings I use the subscribe and save, again very convenient and unique to Amazon. Overall a great shopping experience. This is why I come back, I order from Amazon almost every week.  Oh and the customer service is so easy to deal with, they will help you in no time and fix whatever issue you might have. The only problem I have I would say is if Amazon would accept PayPal, this would be the best of the best... still highly recommended.
amazon	Justin	2012-06-01T22:37:19Z	1	They've really changed their policy with regards to returns and price matching.  I'm not shopping here anymore until they go back to good customer service.
amazon	Ann-Marie Brewer	2012-06-01T18:04:39Z	5	Never had any sort of issue.  I always get exactly what i order, exactly when i'm supposed to get it.  And they charge me exactly what they say they will.
amazon	Lauren Smith	2012-06-01T17:15:56Z	5	We live in a small town and local shopping is very limited so we use Amazon all the time. It never lets us down. I love the book reviews and having so many options for buying new and used ones. I love being able to review and find several choices for tech accessories. Amazon is one stop shopping I trust.
amazon	Connie Muzer	2012-06-01T14:46:08Z	5	You can find just about anything on Amazon.  Love the site.  Easy to use.  If any problems with an order, always easily resolved.

amazon	Martin Ailion	2012-06-01T08:49:59Z	5	I've found using Amazon gives me a sense of security. I can check the reviews of the companies and businesses that go 'through' them, and knowing that fact, as well as being able to compare the different prices, is why i like to go through Amazon when first looking for an item to buy. So far I have never been disappointed and as long as that continues, then I will recommend them to friends and family.
amazon	Jean Pol	2012-06-01T00:48:00Z	5	Have ordered numerous items through Amazon.  Always delivered as described and promptly.  Love them
amazon	Pauline Yamanaka	2012-05-31T23:15:47Z	5	I upgraded to Prime a while back and love the quick shipping. More importantly, when a package was stolen off my front porch, they shipped a replacement no questions asked *next day* air for no extra charge. You can't beat that.
amazon	Glenn	2012-05-31T22:37:39Z	5	Whenever I have to purchase something online, I always start on Amazon. If they don't have what I'm looking for, I usually reconsider my need before going elsewhere. In seven years of being a customer, I've seldom been disappointed.

amazon	Jenny Smith	2012-05-30T14:49:33Z	5	My first stop for ALL on-line purchases is Amazon.com.  We pay for the Prime account and love having the quick and free shipping option this provides.  Since Amazon is SO much more than books, its a one-stop shop for SO many items we need regularly and the special occasion items as well.

amazon	Tom Stein	2012-05-28T12:13:54Z	2	I had a $100 gift voucher given to me as a present and was horrified to find I couldnt transfer the value to the uk site. To use it in the .com site involved more money than the goods in shipping. Sad to say voucher stays on the account. Motto of the story is unless you want amazon to benefit from your money or your American living in America dont give their vouchers. Their customer service people dont answer questions so I presume they dont read them.
amazon	Carolyn Drew	2012-05-27T22:02:51Z	5	Never had a problem and always receive quality products quickly.  I get what I order and if their is a delay am informed of when I will receive my merchandise.
amazon	Adam	2012-05-27T00:34:14Z	5	A very high quality service which over the past years has provided me with top quality items at very low prices and the customer service they provide for looking after their customers is excellent.I have also tried the amazon prime trial which was fantastic and if in a big family such as myself the cost of such a service is very cheap and well worth it. <-- It's bringing in new innovative features such as this that makes Amazon so popular!Truly a Fantastic Seller which I would highly recommend to anyone.
amazon	Rebecca Pinard	2012-05-26T14:15:48Z	5	Everything I have ordered has been exactly as described and of good quality.  Also delivery was extremely fast.  Good service, no problems!
amazon	James	2012-05-26T11:43:50Z	3	I think Amazon could take a leaf out of Ebays ebook when it comes to navigation/listing/cataloging etc. It's irritating to browse.

amazon	nJoy3	2012-05-24T12:42:14Z	5	Enjoy the one-stop shopping of Amazon to reduce shipping expenses...usually.  And if they don't have it?  Well, it probably isn't worth having?!  :)
amazon	Titus Lerinc	2012-05-23T18:23:10Z	5	Prices are very competetive.
amazon	Andrew McLaughlin	2012-05-23T14:17:09Z	4	never had a problem and i have used every service ranging from refund, to wrong products to incorrect payment deductions, company's should be judged on how they deal with a problem, and Amazon.... deal with it!

The prices are great, and you can get free shipping on so many products. I'm signed up for Amazon Prime, so I get free 2-day shipping on most of my purchases!
amazon	Sayed Sreejon	2012-05-22T22:44:07Z	5	Amazon is a great market.
amazon	M J EVANS	2012-05-22T17:02:06Z	4	good savings on most but delivery prices unreasonably estimated
amazon	Henry Mitchell	2012-05-22T15:18:17Z	5	Amazon never fail to resolve problems, even when they could claim it wasn't their fault.  They always compensate when something isn't right, rather than just apologising and doing nothing about it.  This is why I go back to Amazon time and time again, they care about their customers and it shows.
amazon	m a robson	2012-05-22T10:28:40Z	5	I have always had a great experience dealing with Amazon; I would recommend them to everyone

Their site is easy to use and I can always find anything I want from product to info on my orders, past and present. Will continue to shop with them as the need arises.
amazon	Very unhappy	2012-05-21T01:40:25Z	5	Always an A+ experience on Amazon.  Fast shipping and reliable merchants.
amazon	Linda C	2012-05-21T01:12:55Z	5	Amazon is where I always go first to shop and compare cost when I need something. I couldn't live without Amazon Prime! And the time to receive most orders is better than anywhere on the internet.
amazon	Susan Cabot	2012-05-20T13:47:01Z	5	Amazon allows me to peruse the web without going all over the place. It has provided a reliable, no hassle shopping experience that I greatly appreciate.

amazon	Otis Glamore	2012-05-19T19:24:31Z	5	"Every purchase I have made through Amazon has lived up to the description, arrived on time (often, the next day) and intact, and had a competitive, if not better, price. Their return policy is so fair that I once was allowed to return a 40"" TV just because I had ordered the wrong model.Because I trust this company, I always go to their website first to see if they have the product I'm looking for."
amazon	Carl	2012-05-19T12:01:03Z	5	I only discovered Amazon last year, and I certainly feel like I've been missing out! Since, I order from Amazon almost every week.The best prices on the web, great support and extremely fast shipping options makes for a brilliant user experience. Would highly recommend!

amazon	John Whitehead	2012-05-18T11:34:46Z	3	Ordering goods, no issues, however the so called amazon prime is hit and miss, and when you complain they extend it by 1 month....why when it doesn't work as intended, if you purchased next day delivery elsewhere it arrives.
amazon	Tricia	2012-05-18T09:44:26Z	5	We are prime consumers and my bookaholic husband couldn't be happier with the accuracy of orders and quick delivery.

amazon	Cynthia Tice	2012-05-17T15:22:12Z	5	"I have purchased from Amazon for years but recently decided to go with ""Prime"" and I could kick myself for not doing it many years and dollars ago!  Silly me.  And the Subscribe & Save Program is genius!  Now I order even more - for less price and free shipping.   Love it!"
amazon	John Hopwood	2012-05-17T07:04:13Z	5	Their free deliveries to Spain are a boon

amazon	Susan Shepard	2012-05-16T21:30:49Z	1	"Their ""Free Shipping"" has become relegated to the Post Office.They are NOT freight shippers!!!  Boxes usually end up broken, retaped, badly mistreated but Amazon doesnt care its cheap!Its NOT Free for us, one still has to get to the PO and since when is the price of gas free???Im looking elsewhere to find Free Shipping"

amazon	Carlo LaTonya Bowens	2012-05-15T19:15:30Z	5	So much variety and great prices. I can find almost everything I need on Amazon
amazon	K Gibson	2012-05-15T19:09:13Z	5	I've ordered so many items I can't even keep track. I only had one problem and that was easily fixed. If it's shipped from Amazon, it is usually fast and the prices are good. I look on Amazon first.
amazon	Andrew	2012-05-15T18:58:47Z	5	What can I say, one of the very few companies who do not let you down on price, delivery and customer service. Not found another online megastore which has come to close.
amazon	Sean Beaumont	2012-05-15T11:25:42Z	5	I live in Germany and come back to the UK regularly.  If ever I want to buy anything I always trawl the net to see where I can get it the cheapest and I would say 85% of the time I don't need to look beyong Amazon.  I have bought everything from books to CD's to 9 man tents to luxury knives and every time delvery has been great and the transaction smooth and trouble free.  There is almost nothing you can't buy from them.  Much better than e-bay that's for sure and more trustworthy - that goes for the private Amazon sellers as well.
amazon	Beverly Hetrick	2012-05-15T06:06:52Z	5	Have always found satisfaction with this company. They make shopping on line a very pleasant experience. Keep up the good work at Amaon!!!
amazon	Susan Buethe Harrison	2012-05-15T04:27:57Z	5	Nope, not on the Amazon payroll, but just can't believe how many things they offer now, and the speed/efficiency of their service.  Even returns are easy, if you have to do it.   The prices for everything I check are a few dollars under anyone else, and the items arrive beautifully-boxed in a matter of two or three days.  Awesome, don't ever go away Amazon!!
amazon	Maybe Another Time	2012-05-15T03:57:39Z	5	I have never had any reason to regret any order from Amazon.
amazon	Sam	2012-05-14T21:26:39Z	5	I have opted for the prime service given how often I use amazon which means that I get fast service each time without having to pay the postage each time. This said Love film appears to be slowly getting worse as a result of amazon's ownership
amazon	Kari	2012-05-14T19:50:58Z	5	You can find everything you are looking for and get it relatively quick.
amazon	Ceitllyn	2012-05-14T17:55:20Z	1	I have never had good customer service with Amazon.  They sell objectionable books, the site is not very easy to go through and sometimes the information is confusing.
amazon	Ahmed Hosenbabul	2012-05-14T07:16:02Z	5	its a nice web and we can purchase any thing from here.They supplies very quick.
amazon	Father Andrew J. Vollkommer	2012-05-14T06:55:41Z	5	I have been an almost daily customer of Amazon.Com for about three years now! I have bought everything from underwear to camera equipment to Greek Orthodox Easter bread to hard to find theological books on Amazon.Com.  You can get super fast shipping by signing up for Amazon.Prime and you'll save a TON of money on shipping.  I have come to trust Amazon.Com to provide the lowest prices anywhere--even better than those of clubs like Books A Million Discount Cards.   The variety and choices are great.  Even their third party vendors provide wonderful service.  Amazon.Com is certainly where it is at! Returns are also a snap!
amazon	Debbie Stoyer	2012-05-13T22:11:25Z	5	the order came on time they were very helpful
amazon	Mrs S.L.Cooke	2012-05-13T10:33:05Z	5	I have always been more than satisfied with Amazon and have used it a lot.  They are extremely reliable and I have always received prompt deliveries.  I frequently recommend them to others.
amazon	linda byrd	2012-05-13T02:28:25Z	5	The item arrive within 3 business day.  they even give me a tracking number.
amazon	Nick	2012-05-13T02:27:18Z	4	I have used amazon for years & have only had positive expirences with them.
amazon	Petrina Bradbrook	2012-05-12T09:16:01Z	4	Always good service with amazon, postage can be a little slower than hoped for using the standard service but then I guess that's down to Royal Mail.
amazon	Matthew Mullin	2012-05-12T00:02:59Z	5	Quick and easy can't beat it they have everything you need
amazon	Thomas Najar	2012-05-11T10:10:57Z	3	Hard to find stuff even with their search engine. You ask for a specific description and they serve up everything else as well. Very hard to navigate through hundreds of pages finding that one item you wanted to find with the search key.Also slow with shipping.
amazon	Shirley Blair	2012-05-11T07:03:21Z	5	I almost always look at Amazon.com first for things I want. Even if I look somewhere else first, I usually end up buying it at Amazon. It can pretty much be said to have literally everything.
amazon	John C. Gaughan	2012-05-11T03:45:32Z	3	Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.
amazon	M H	2012-05-10T22:50:18Z	5	Always have a good experiance with Amazon
amazon	Kim	2012-05-10T19:27:55Z	5	I shop amazon all the time and whenever there has been an issue they always take care of it.  I would recommend it

amazon	Hilary Matthews	2012-05-10T16:55:21Z	5	I love Amazon - it is trustworthy and a great site to get everything I need
amazon	Cait	2012-05-10T15:21:58Z	5	Amazon nearly always has exactly what I want for the best price, and with their Prime 2-day shipping most things arrive quickly plus Prime gives other benefits like lower-priced or free movies.  Also appreciated are those items that can be ordered on a repeating schedule of our choice.
amazon	Patricia	2012-05-10T14:06:30Z	5	I love shopping with Amazon.com because they make it so easy, and I am always satisfied with everything I buy. They also offer so much in the product line. I really like the ability to purchase music through the Amazon MP3 and choose only the songs I want, and the Amazon Cloud is great!
amazon	Janet Powell-Perry	2012-05-10T10:37:49Z	5	If I want it quickly at a competitive price its straight to Amazon
amazon	Matt Robbins	2012-05-10T09:42:41Z	5	No matter what I am looking for, Amazon seem to have it. And at competitive prices too.
amazon	Sandra Kirby McLeod, PhD	2012-05-10T06:58:15Z	5	We order weekly from Amazon and are never disappointed by late deliveries.  Orders arrive when they are expected to arrive, always packaged well to preserve the integrity of the book covers.  Whatever one's book needs, Amazon will have it or find it.  Sandra McLeod
amazon	mos nana	2012-05-10T05:17:43Z	5	Love my kindle and the books.  Have ordered other products with great satisfaction

amazon	Stéphanie	2012-05-09T13:46:09Z	5	Each purchase went well or was either returned and reimbursed without any delay.
amazon	John Maller	2012-05-08T22:11:48Z	4	I ordered a lot of times with Amazon and normally everything is perfect. However, sometimes it takes a day or two longer than it should according to their website. Maybe it's my postman though?
amazon	Moriah Mo	2012-05-08T19:35:18Z	4	I love to shop online and compare prices. Amazon always has the lowest prices and the products are amazing. I just make sure i check the sellers reviews because there are some people who dont know what they are selling.
amazon	julia	2012-05-08T19:17:49Z	5	the best! great prices! fast shipping!!
amazon	breda o'neill-collins	2012-05-08T17:50:26Z	5	i just love amazon have never any complaints even when i needed to return it was hassle free and they always give great description of items and always arrive on time my only problem is when i am purchasing from IRELAND i have to wait until it get to checkout to see if the company i am ordering from will deliver to me and often am disappointed especially when i ordered 52 items one day and only 2 would deliver to ireland it was just so disappointing to have to delete so much but was delighted when i contacted this company directly i was allowed to order on their own website.

amazon	PEGGY	2012-05-04T14:16:40Z	5	EVERYTHING I BUT I LOVE.
amazon	Walter	2012-05-04T04:07:26Z	1	"Amazon misled me with an inaccurate photograph of a German made screw driver set that most people including me would have absolutely no use for.  When I discovered the mistake, I contacted them and a customer service representative told me to ""refuse the package"" which contained another tool that I needed.  They also said I could use the return process, but only the same replacement item can be exchanged.  So I didn't get what I needed, plus I'm stuck with something I will never use.  There was a time Amazon provided excellent customer service, but apparently those days are past."
amazon	Omri Arad	2012-05-03T18:16:34Z	5	I just had an experience with the Amazon Customer service, it was quick, friendly, dealt with all my problems, and basically made me believe in customer service again.Thank you amazon

amazon	Colin Wallace	2012-05-02T09:28:25Z	5	Goods always delivered quickly and as described. Comminication is excellent. On the one problem I had with a faulty camera when it was still in warranty, they replaced it immediately.

amazon	Jean	2012-04-23T13:41:07Z	4	I purchase many things on Amazon. Love the prices. I recently made a purchase where they split the order in 2. I had to pay for 2 separate  shipping orders. My shipping costs, cost more than my order!!!

amazon	Chris Burns	2012-04-23T10:38:59Z	5	Have bought several items from Amazon & have been very impressed with the ease of finding specific goods, the quick & efficient delivery & the good quality of those goods.
amazon	Kristian Morey	2012-04-23T04:49:09Z	1	Amazon is a terrible company to sell with, since you cannot differentiate your products and they implemented their fulfillment program its nearly impossible to stay competitive in this marketplace. As for regulations on refunds and private dealings with customers, they are 100% anti seller. Do not buy from them they are always overpriced compared to ebay or ebid, and do not sell from them.
amazon	Joyce	2012-04-22T17:06:47Z	5	Better and cheaper than any stores...and in my opinion, their Prime program can't be beat...
amazon	Lu Ding	2012-04-22T08:51:59Z	5	easy to get refund, easy to trust

amazon	Spitfirenellie	2012-04-19T18:50:53Z	5	I have been buying from Amazon for many years, books, CD's, Electricals' , christmas gift, the list is endless. Prices are always competitive, delivery effortless, even during the extreme cold of christmas 2010, items still seemed to arrive with 24 hours.Amazon does exactly what it aims to do, and it does it very well.
amazon	Richard Clark	2012-04-19T16:31:48Z	4	I go to Amazon for many online purchases nowadays - on the whole their prices are some of the best, and the choice is excellent.There is a lack of detailed descriptions on some items though, and occasionally you take a gamble that something is the correct dimensions or is exactly the model you are looking for.I would happily recommend it though.
amazon	darioi	2012-04-19T14:34:55Z	5	Good experience in books, cd and other. No problem with return or substitution in case of mistakes

amazon	Kristin	2012-04-18T17:07:13Z	5	They have EVERYTHING.  So, I just ask for Amazon GCs for birthdays and Christmas.  Every year I  build up a nice credit balance that I can use anytime.  Also, it can be good for all my friends & family, who are online, so it's easy to just send GCs for birthday gifts.  One-stop, all occasion solution.  I love the reviews; so helpful for making my shopping decisions.
amazon	PETER BOUD	2012-04-18T13:50:46Z	4	I have always been very impressed with the service provided
amazon	Chris BH	2012-04-18T13:02:24Z	4	This review is split in two: - One for buying direct from Amazon (5* no question, best internet retailer by a mile) - One for buying from Amazon Market place (2* great until you have a problem)Amazon direct:What more is there to say about Amazon, when you order from them directly then it is flawless, any problems are taken away by their outstanding customer service team. They impress me every time.Amazon market place:Essentially one would expect that if you buy it via market place then since it goes through Amazon's engine and has their brand in front of it you'd think they would want to protect this and thus apply pressure to shoddy marketplace practices from some of the retailers. They don't. I bought some headphones, they broke after 3 months, so I requested a return from the company. Initially contact was good, then it all went quiet and I found myself contacting Amazon to request they gave them a bit of a nudge to play ball. Nothing. To cut a long story short, after several attempts with Amazon to get them to earn the cut of the sale that they put through their website I ended up going direct to the manufacturer. They told me that they didn't guarentee anything bought from the marketplace as there were a lot of fakes on there. I asked them to look at my phone anyway and tell me if they were fakes as I would have had far more to go back to Amazon with if they were and pointed out that they were in their first year of service and were guarenteed. Luckily they weren't fakes and they replaced them immediately, but Amazon's halo slipped dramatically for me as a result. If you want your cut of the money Amazon then sometimes you have to do the dirty work too.If you steer clear of the marketplace then you will never go wrong with the mighty Amazon though.
amazon	Simon	2012-04-17T23:58:15Z	5	I love Amazon. They have a great range of products at competitive prices. They arent as cheap as ebay - but you have the Amazon guarantee which you dont with e-bay and thats worth paying a little more for the peace of mind.A tip is that its always worth checking out the Amazon price with free delivery before buying form someone else on Amazon, becasue although there prices may appear cheaper than Amazons, by the time you add on postage Amazon nearly always is cheaper.Customer service is superb. Why shop naywhere else?
amazon	James Wood	2012-04-17T17:59:25Z	5	Bought a phenomenol amount of products from Amazon due to the endless choice and their service has always been exceptional too. It literally is pointless shopping anywhere else except the supermarket for food ;-)
amazon	Debra	2012-04-17T17:54:16Z	5	Ease of use, offers so much you can't imagine and is usually cheaper.
amazon	Gary Kirby	2012-04-17T15:49:22Z	5	The best online site by far
amazon	Sebastian	2012-04-17T14:55:40Z	5	Excellent service, good prices and prompt delivery! I have bought there several times and it always worked perfect.
amazon	kevin fitzpatrick	2012-04-17T13:57:13Z	5	Amazon is my go to shopping destination. Whatever Jeff Bezos has done to train his service people should be cloned and taught in business school. On the very rare occasions that I've had a mishap over the years, Amazon has taken care of things rapidly, with courtesy and understanding. The only thing I'd like to see is an easier link to find for customer service, they kinda have it buried.
amazon	Roger Pagett	2012-04-17T11:21:52Z	4	I've never had any problems and delivery times are always very good

amazon	Dennis Harvey	2012-04-15T16:25:03Z	5	Good choice and reliable delivery
amazon	Dave Dickie	2012-04-15T15:50:14Z	5	It's hard to beat amazon's selection and price.  You can do it if you work at it; on the other hand, if you do a lot of purchases on the internet, the effort in finding and ordering the better deal just isn't worth it.
amazon	Mr B Walters	2012-04-15T09:30:43Z	5	there web site is very good and has competitive prices to suit everyone

Far beyond their original offering of books and DVDs, I now buy everything - from Cartier scent to Brabantia rubbish bags - on Amazon. They all reach me in the heart of the Tuscan countryside - and P & P is FREE! Brilliant.
amazon	Kim Belsey	2012-04-13T00:07:16Z	5	When you use amazon a fair bit, the prime delivery option is a life saver..... fast and guaranteed delivery's . Surprised at how much choice there is these days ,looking forward to Prime choice getting expanded further , great service.

amazon	John Broughton	2012-04-07T04:59:54Z	3	I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated delivery time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.
amazon	Chris Griffiths	2012-04-06T23:14:35Z	1	Poor service for such a large company!
amazon	June Hardacre	2012-04-06T20:29:01Z	5	Amazon are excellent on prices and goods. Quick delivery and I was kept up to date with details of delivery by e-mail.I would always recommend Amazon to all

amazon	jules	2012-04-05T12:34:31Z	1	I opened an account.Bought a book.Then I bought a printer worth over £500.Amazon blocked the order wanting me to fax (what is that?) over all my bank details.  I tried to find Amazon's telephone number, but couldn't.  Googled it and found it eventually.  Had a long, long conversation with a lady who didn't seem to realise that you are helpful to customers especially in a recession.  Bought the printer in less than two minutes on eBay.

amazon	Martin Robinson	2012-04-04T10:47:49Z	5	There was a time when I purchased an Asus Netbook. It lasted 10 months and the hard drive packed in. I sent it off to Asus to repair and they were not terrible. When I got the Netbook back it lasted 5 days and packed up again.When I called them back they said I had to get a specific receipt this time (for some weird reason) with a bar code on it and to get it from Amazon. I called Amazon and they said to return it back to them for a full refund!!I was blown away but it works, even if I see a product in the shops cheaper (very rare) I will still order it from Amazon.

amazon	Steve Walker	2012-04-02T13:51:07Z	5	Amazon is my first port of call for MP3 downloads (I disapprove of iTunes DRM).  I have a Kindle, and the Kindle experience is excellent.  And Amazon is a first-class place to check out prices and also to provide reassurance, when buying, that the person you're buying from is legit.
amazon	Jerry Caccavaro	2012-04-01T00:22:23Z	5	I purchase everything at Amazon and I have never had a problem that they couldn't resolve. I purchased a Kindle Fire and decided I didn't want it. They took it back and refunded all my money without question. I did this twice. I know own the 3rd Kindle Fire I purchased and love it. I don't thing that there is anything that cannot be found on Amazon. I am a customer for life.

amazon	Phyllis Dodzweit	2012-03-31T23:36:47Z	5	I have ordered merchandise from Amazon.com several times and also have had to request a duplicate merchandise receipt in order to validate a purchase when a product (watch) stopped running within the warranty period.  Amazon.com came thru helping me quickly.  I also believe that the books that I have ordered were purchased at a great price.
amazon	Pauline McNamara	2012-03-31T22:53:12Z	5	Amazon is everything a site should be.  It is super easy to find what I want, and shipping is generally pretty fast.  I invested in a Kindle Fire this year, it is so easy to use -- absolutely seamless with Amazon.com.
amazon	Irene Grant	2012-03-31T19:56:47Z	5	I order a lot of books and CD's from Amazon and always marvel at he speed by which they are delivered.   Well done!

amazon	Mitchell McClure	2012-03-30T16:07:04Z	5	They are a great company and online site.They are very competitive in price and are usually cheaper than most places and have a great return policy.
amazon	Janet O'Neill	2012-03-30T15:28:39Z	5	I have used Amazon for a few years now and thoroughly recommend them for all types of purchases.
amazon	Gordon Munro	2012-03-30T00:41:45Z	1	Items purchased over £400 cannot be sent overseas (BFPO Adresses) Very poor excuse.
amazon	Invictus	2012-03-29T19:13:48Z	5	Excellent products, excellent customer service, excellent everything. More companies should try to live up to the Amazon level of professionalism and quality. I was hesitant to open an Amazon account a couple of years ago, but I don't look back with any regrets now. I don't know how I'd live without it. So much better that dealing with people and issues of poor customer service from Wal-mart. I only wish I had known about Amazon earlier, and opened an account sooner. Amazon has been the absolute best in every way. It's my favorite place to shop and browse.

amazon	Linasc	2012-03-26T17:32:07Z	5	I have been an Amazon shopper and fan for a long, long time - probably 7-8 years now. I have always had a great experience - they offer the best prices and a lot of information about the products from other shoppers. Their web site is very user-friendly - popping up the most useful reviews to the top. The orders are shipped very fast and packaged very nicely. Returns are easy and hassle-free. Customer service is great - very knowledgeable staff, polite and always available. You can contact them in no time - by email or phone. I will remain a loyal customer because I get great service and value. Lina Scorza
amazon	Donna	2012-03-26T15:05:56Z	5	You can keep ebay, I love Amazon. I have always found a great bargain on this site and there is usually a variety of delivery options which include the illusive free ones. I would be very hard pushed to find anything wrong with this site. I have only had one instance when a delivery didn't arrive and Amazon put a replacement straight into the post, no argument. Keep up the good work.
amazon	Anna Hamel	2012-03-26T12:10:28Z	5	great delivery, great products,

amazon	X pheature X	2012-03-24T20:41:49Z	5	awsome site.
amazon	Shepard Ofpeace	2012-03-24T20:09:42Z	4	You can find almost anything at a good price, used, new, and you don't have to purchase from a big box store to get what you need.  Do all your shopping at home, what can be more convenient.  Just one problem, they don't accept pay pal.  Hope you get that fixed, until then I can only give you four stars.
amazon	wahab	2012-03-24T16:17:55Z	5	i love the prices on amazon cheaper the nearly all the other companies and you can find anything and when its free super saver delivery well that's just the icing on the cake,the parcel always arrive on time.

amazon	Ignacio Torres	2012-03-23T19:24:07Z	5	This is the most amazing store ever. They have a great customer service and everything arrives on time.Never had a problem that hasn't been solved by them. Totally recommended!!!
amazon	Norman Brown	2012-03-23T17:05:42Z	3	You generally find what you need but after you go through the whole procedure of entering details etc, you get the statement that item cannot be shipped to your country. This should be in the item description so as to avoid waste of time and disappointment.

amazon	Keith J Bell	2012-03-22T12:24:17Z	1	"My mother-in-law bought a Kindle and tried to purchase some books from Amazon but needed an email address to create an Amazon login, which she doesn't have.  All Amazon customer services could do was continually repeat afetr every question was that you required an email address to set up an account.  They couldn't point me to anything on their website or point of sale literature that states implicitly they requirement of an email address to purchase books and the only 'solution' that they could come up with was ""couldn't you let your mother-in-law use your email address"".  POOR, VERY POOR."

amazon	Kathy D.	2012-03-21T20:41:06Z	5	I got so tired of going into a bookstore and them trying to sell me their special membership that I started ordering from amazon.com. Now, after many, many transactions, I've been totally pleased with the results. I even find specialized religious books which are difficult to get from other stores. Shipping has always been on time and I receive e-mails to tell me where my package is. I'm now looking at getting a Kindle Fire because I think so much of amazon.com!
amazon	Amsterdam 007	2012-03-21T18:29:53Z	5	Amazing website with huge amount of categories to choose from. Every book I ordered from them arrived promptly, in a timely manner. You can always check where the goods are with a shipping tracker. Their package is of excellent quality too, designed to maximally protect the shipped goods. I am very happy with Amazon's services and will continue to buy from them, that's for sure!

amazon	Ms Doyle	2012-03-20T20:47:32Z	5	I use Amazon a lot because it is easy to compare prices and very easy to order with 'One Click' I live in a fairly remote place and I work full time so getting to shops can be tricky. Buying on line is easy and efficient.
amazon	Heather Cenek	2012-03-20T18:21:05Z	5	Amazon is a staple for my Xmas shopping. They make any gift giving an easy task even for the pickiest people. I go to Amazon for everyone & their variety of products make shopping so easy.

amazon	Juyee Teo	2012-03-19T20:58:38Z	3	Amazon sell good products at good prices.  However, I have found recently Amazon does not sell ALL products at the cheapest price.  I now have to shop around to check if Amazon is bargain.  Otherwise, it is a good company.
amazon	Darren	2012-03-19T19:26:17Z	5	Ordered many items have found site is slightly dearer than eBay but has the excellent service of always delivering.

amazon	Tameem Shaik	2012-03-17T23:16:13Z	3	Most of the stuff I usually buy from amazon and I still do that but I really hate the way customer service works...because you have to explain your query to customer service from the beginning if you have to call them again...
amazon	Bill	2012-03-17T22:29:20Z	5	Long time user, very happy.

amazon	Chris Edmondson	2012-03-17T11:33:14Z	5	I wanted to get the Food for Free books.We love the idea of self sufficiency and got the books to find out how easy it is.   It really is easy! There is so much wild food that is free to pick & use.Did you know that if you are in the vehicle behind one that hits a pheasant. deer or rabbit? - you are entitled to pick it up for your own use.I did! I picked up a lovely fresh road kill pheasant which along with young nettles (taste like spinach) & wild garlic with home grown potatoes was really tasty. Total cost approximately 0.10p for the seed potatoes.
amazon	Legend's Mom	2012-03-17T00:54:07Z	5	I can count on Amazon Ito help me get the best price on almost anything!

amazon	Adam Zulli	2012-03-16T17:05:57Z	3	I ordered some SIP phones and after week of not being shipped tried to canceled them , but they said was already shipped however  no tracking number was provided.
amazon	Christian Peter	2012-03-16T15:57:38Z	5	Buying at Amazon is always a pleasant experience. The on-line shop is well organized. It is easy to find the article of you choice and having user reviews available is invaluable to make up your mind.One-click ordering is so much easier than any other web-shop. It is also easy to understand the status of your order while it is being processed and shipped.In the unlikely event that you want to return an article, Amazon is a pleasant experience as well.
amazon	Deborah	2012-03-16T13:33:32Z	5	Brilliant customer service - that's what makes shopping on-line as stress free as possible. And I think Amazon have got this down to a fine art. No quibble returns on goods, fast service and always in contact should they think they've not come up to scratch (I've had two emails with money back initiated by them because things have turned up one day late... now that's service!). Amazon are not always the cheapest, but rarely do I find them expensive, and by the time shipping is factored in (I'm a Prime member, so much is free!!!) they are one of the most cost-effective sites I have found. Backed by their customer service, I find it stress free to buy online... not something that can be said for all online retailers. The breadth of product offerings is great. I have Amazon Prime because it saves me a lot on shipping. This beats much of the shopping experience on the high street for me... I can check competitiveness of prices, compare brands and sort out delivery all from the comfort of my laptop. ...and don't even start me on the wonders of Kindle. So many books... so little time. Thanks Amazon... I'm a big fan :)
amazon	Mr. P McLoughlin	2012-03-16T07:32:22Z	5	Customer services second to none

amazon	Paddy Lawson	2012-03-15T09:26:53Z	5	I have been dealing with Amazon for many years and have always had first class service from them. Knowing I don't have to worry about the quality of goods or if I have ordered something by mistake - their 'no quibble' refund policy means I can buy on line with confidence.
amazon	Lisa	2012-03-15T02:53:24Z	5	"Prices are usually great, particularly on items sold by Amazon (there are other sellers on their marketplace as well). Shipping is lightening fast, even with ""Free Super Saver Shipping"". Most items I have ordered arrived before the earliest date specified in the delivery window."
amazon	CELIA MUNGO	2012-03-14T21:19:36Z	5	A brilliant company - would certainly recommend, good prices, speedy delivery, well packaged and good choices - what more can one ask.Excellent and thank you

amazon	Richard Anderson	2012-03-14T13:16:22Z	4	Have been using Amazon since they first opened. They are a company I trust to consistently deliver great service and products. On the rare occasion where I've had an issue, they are quick to resolve and have always done the right thing. I think that's an important measure when selecting a company to do business with.
amazon	Mr R Snusher	2012-03-14T11:39:23Z	5	good deals on here
amazon	Wendy McCormack	2012-03-14T09:11:28Z	5	I always check Amazon first, will look at prices elsewhere sometimes but usually best price is through Amazon. Easy site to use and delivery dates are clearly shown. Bought items very straightforward to track. Great company.
amazon	Giselle	2012-03-14T08:45:24Z	5	I have bought books from them for many years and recently other products. I have never had any problems with delivery. Occasional items that went astray or were faulty were quickly refunded or replaced without fuss.

amazon	Margaret M	2012-03-13T17:08:26Z	5	The website is clear and simple to use, fast and informative. It has a huge range of products which are always honestly described and fairly priced. I always check Amazon before going to any other website.
amazon	mrs carol smith	2012-03-13T14:49:51Z	5	brill site its a pleasure to browes
amazon	Nick	2012-03-13T05:24:33Z	5	Amazon have created an easy-to-use, efficient, purchasing powerhouse that makes shopping a pleasure
amazon	Peter Crosskey	2012-03-12T21:17:35Z	3	The local Royal Mail sorting office would be half empty if it wasn't for Amazon's business. But no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list: there is a razor sharp focus in the search engine, but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent. Sorry guys, but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset, if we ever had a title or author to start with.
amazon	Susan Edge	2012-03-12T18:40:55Z	5	I would recomend Amazon to anyone i had a Dyson delivered i couldnt get the model nearest store was 60 mile away. They carnt be beaten for lots of items
amazon	Michael Clatworthy	2012-03-12T18:39:07Z	5	One of the best retailers online. Returns policy is second to none. Prime is worth subscribing to if you regularly buy from Amazon as it really enhances delivery. However they are not always the cheapest depending on what you are after, especially if the item can only be bought through a third party seller. This is one area where Amazon is let down as third party sellers are only as good as the person you are buying from. As a result we only now tend to by items that allow Amazon Prime,
amazon	Iva Bircher	2012-03-12T11:32:30Z	5	THEY ALWAYS HAVE WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR.
amazon	Chris L. Phillips	2012-03-12T00:40:46Z	5	I hate crowds and driving to 10 places to find exactly what I want and need.  Instead, I shop at Amazon the world's biggest store and most of the time pay little or no shipping.  When you need it, what could be better?
amazon	NJ pet owner	2012-03-11T22:55:47Z	4	They have almost everything and delivery is very quick.
amazon	Doug Oriard	2012-03-11T21:15:48Z	5	Wide product selection, good prices. Very good return policy.  User reviews are available on most products which is essential in finding a good  product.  I do most of my online shopping here.The only down-side to this site is that the product descriptions are not very detailed.  I often have to get the manufacturer part number and then go elsewhere to get the detailed product specifications.
amazon	Angela	2012-03-11T20:10:28Z	5	Have never been disappointed in Amazon's service. They make it easy to compare products and prices.
amazon	ross cain	2012-03-11T13:26:01Z	5	Always a top class service.
amazon	Peter Lenham	2012-03-11T11:42:46Z	4	Amazon have helped me out when it comes to buying games and have been great help when it comes to my products going missing. They have either gave me a refund or replace the product free of charge.
amazon	Abby	2012-03-11T09:39:44Z	5	Fantastic range of goods , fast efficient service even better if you subscribe to amazon prime.
amazon	Brenda Ramirez	2012-03-11T06:26:13Z	5	Most websites have this option of saving a wishlist, my favorite sites have the option of saving items on the websites personal wish list or on amazon's wish list.  I can't always remember all of the website where I have items saved, or which item is in which website; I can, however, always go on amazon and check all of the items I have saved (no matter what website they are from), and there is always the option of grouping different items together.Love It!!
amazon	Karen	2012-03-10T19:44:47Z	5	Very pleased everytime I use Amazon.

amazon	Hillary	2012-03-09T05:24:33Z	1	I recently had a problem with my kindle app for Mac OS X.  I called customer service to get help.  The man's english was so poor that I had to repeat myself several times for him to finally understand what I was talking about.  He then asked me to go to the amazon website and search for troubleshooting in the search all field at the top of the website.  He didn't even know how to navigate the website!  I had to explain to him how to get to the help section for kindle on the amazon website.  Finally he put me on hold for several minutes.  While on hold I googled solutions for my kindle app.  I was able to solve the problem myself before he even came back to the call.  This was terrible!  I now wish all of my ebooks were not tied up with amazon.
amazon	Jess	2012-03-09T01:39:56Z	5	Go get Amazon Prime. Free 2 day shipping is awesome!

amazon	Catie	2012-03-07T20:08:34Z	4	I've had several bad experiences with other shopping sites, but Amazon is hands down the best in quality and service.
amazon	CoachKerbel	2012-03-07T19:29:05Z	5	I've had Amazon Prime for 2 years, and I love the instant gratification aspect of it. $3.99 shipping for Next Day! Love it.
amazon	Alice Johnson	2012-03-07T12:07:45Z	4	I am an Amazon Prime member and I love it!  For a reasonable fee it gives you free 2 day shipping on the majority of their products.  You also have access to online videos. I also like Amazon because it's easy to keep track of your orders.  And it's easy to do whatever you might need to do with an item for an order, i.e. return, contact seller, etc.  I also like all the reviews that help me make decisions on products I am interested in.I would have given them a 5 star except that there are some items showing up as covered by Amazon Prime but you don't actually get the 2 day shipping.
amazon	Nicola from Nottingham	2012-03-07T11:21:57Z	5	I've always found that Amazon has everything you could ever want at a reasonable price.  Most things brought are sent out very quickly and the returns policy is quick and easy to use.
amazon	Roy Howard	2012-03-07T09:27:07Z	5	The range of goods is vast & they are second to none regards delivery.the site is simple to navigate & once you're registered ordering is quick,simple & painless.Without doubt one of the online's shining stars & recommended without hesitation.NB; If there is an issue with an order then amazon are quick to act to resolve it & have excellent communication.

amazon	ConnieGS	2012-03-07T05:09:55Z	5	"I have been shopping via Amazon for nine years now.  What started out as a book and DVD obsession for me has turned into practically a retailer for most of my needs.  Shipping and prices are the best overall.  Refunds are almost always troublefree.  Frequent buyers are offered unadvertised specials.  If you write good reviews, you may also be asked to join the ""Vine"" program where you are often offered high-end new products to review.The only items I don't buy from Amazon are cameras and high-end lenses.  For that I shop elsewhere."
amazon	susan	2012-03-06T16:09:52Z	4	never had any problems with deliveries and always on time

amazon	Jeannette Weise	2012-03-04T19:08:37Z	5	I had a problem with an item, that I had purchased, that quit working after 2 weeks. Amazon had UPS pick up the item the next business day and they paid for the return. I have never had a company listen to me, like this before, about a purchase. I had a refund within a few days. I have been purchasing items from Amazon for years, but this was the first time I had such a problem. They have been wonderful to order from in the past, but now, I feel much more confident ordering items. I will purchase from them more now then in the past.
amazon	william uftring`	2012-03-04T15:57:19Z	5	AMAZON Is a great place to buy items for a cheaper price....Buy from them offten
amazon	mitch	2012-03-04T03:48:42Z	2	It's not bad..however I dislike when you're not allow to cancel orders place same day, at times it doesn't even allow you to cancel withing an hour, I have lost money for that reason and for the same reason, I can't give five stars.

amazon	Pamela Russell	2012-03-03T11:58:54Z	5	I had ordered a lawn mower from Amazon, & when it arrived the cable lead holders had snapped. I emailed them to ask if they could supply replacement holders,  and received a very courteous reply advising me that they could not, but would replace the whole machine, supplied returns label, & all details I would need to make the return via a courier who would collect from my home.They also upgraded the replacement delivery from Super Saver to First Class.What more could you ask for? Totally impressed with this company, who have never let me down in all the years I have been shopping with them. Brilliant, x
amazon	Elizabeth Taylor	2012-03-02T19:33:33Z	5	I have always had excellent service from Amazon If ever I've had a problem with an item ( which isn't very often ) it's always been dealt with swiftly and efficiently, I am a most satisfied customer.  Many thanks
amazon	J. Dowling	2012-03-02T17:48:15Z	5	Prices are always excellent and delivery times are always quick.  My only problem with Amazon is that they are so good that I spend far more  time and money than I probably should!!  I always recommend Amazon to anyone searching for goods and will continue to go to them first, especially for all my books and DVD's.
amazon	Ayla Wallace	2012-03-02T11:59:01Z	5	Brilliant next day delivery service with plenty of variety to choose from no matter what your looking for
amazon	Ann Prior	2012-03-02T11:22:08Z	5	I'm disabled and don't get out and about much.  I very much appreciate Amazon's range of goods, especially the books, and the value is tremendous.  I have found the most outlandish things on Amazon, such as a Flywhisk for Himself to use when walking the dog on the common in high summer.  If I want something, chances are I'll find it on Amazon. SO much easier than trying to make my way through crowds in my wheelchair!  I do most of my Christmas and Birthday shopping on Amazon now.  So easy, great prices and often postage free delivery.
amazon	Andy B	2012-03-02T08:35:52Z	5	Apparently, they're a small, internet-based shop.  I predict a great future for them.

amazon	Joel Marsh	2012-02-29T18:19:39Z	4	I have ordered many, many books from Amazon, and have never had a problem with a product. Good sellers, good information, and easy-to-find search results. The design of the site really needs to be updated though, and one time a book was actually not in stock when I ordered it, so I waited three weeks to find out it wasn't coming.

amazon	Hal	2012-02-28T14:47:59Z	5	Amazon is usually my first online shopping destination (exceptions being certain specialist item).  Great search facilities, global shopping mall.  When I accidentally end up on the US web site I'd like a button to take me to the corresponding product on the UK site (maybe it exists and I've not found it).

amazon	Mary	2012-02-27T01:42:32Z	5	I have always had excellent experiences with Amazon!  When I have placed an order, it arrives very quickly.

amazon	Jon Loveless	2012-02-22T23:29:04Z	5	I order many things from Amazon - A kindle Fire, ebooks, clothes, computer parts, car parts, and a list too long to mention it all. They have a large warehouse in Phoenix so things arrive a day early if they ship from there. Believe it or not I have never had an issue with merchandise shipped by Amazon or its affiliates except for one Kindle cover which came from Europe. Much bad weather there caused a delay so the company send me another of the same article using a different method. They both arrived so I kept (and paid for) both and gave one as a present. Amazon rocks.
amazon	Mark	2012-02-22T21:05:54Z	2	Some of there resellers are not and the A-Z guarentee.... Hasn't worked yet.

From a halter for my mule to corned beef hash for me, Amazon is the place to search.

My items have all been received on time and have been exactly as described. I always use the Super Saver offer where applicable and this has saved me a substantial amount in postal fees.
amazon	Henry	2012-02-21T22:01:56Z	5	I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!

amazon	Kat	2012-02-20T16:17:02Z	5	This year's Christmas shopping was a breeze. Everything on my list was found on this site and at the lowest cost. We tried to get at least 50% of our products manufactured in the USA, and the description clearly states so if that is the case. I have had zero problems with shipping, and the one return I completed was effortless. This site it amazing, and I look forward to seeing those boxes with the Amazon smile on it :)
amazon	Carl Buckley	2012-02-20T14:16:07Z	3	Seeing Amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different types of goods. The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of goods act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods. Also bad if you have to return damaged goods, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a good way for a company to work.
amazon	Suzy from Bedfordshire	2012-02-20T13:28:48Z	5	I have brought many times on Amazon the past 5 years, these include items as gifts, GCSE books and have even used some vouchers I received.  A reliable service that is fast and has great communications. I have recently gone to order a very nice chess set which was unfortunately out of stock, however the seller and Amazon themselves kept me informed as soon as possible and whilst I await another set like it, Amazon continue to find me alternatives that I may be interested in. The only one thing I find not as easy or accessible on the site is leaving feedback but once I got the knack, I always leave my thoughts and to date they have all been POSITIVE.. Thank You Amazon!
amazon	Mrs Susan Slater	2012-02-20T09:47:14Z	5	Order many various things, absolutely love their service, it is so easy. Love the fact that all your card details, personal details and delivery addresses are stored so do not have to type in repeatedly!Also, love how they respond and resolve any problems with unwanted and/or faulty goods.

amazon	Ruth	2012-02-18T07:40:37Z	1	After purchasing a kitchen electrical appliance from Amazon last year.  I was very disappointed to find it impossible to get help to return the product when it failed to work properly.  I also find their website too messy and complicated.....not an online shop for me.
amazon	Lynn Wood	2012-02-17T23:58:00Z	5	When dealing with Amazon direct the price and service is superb.With others it tends to be pot luck but Amazon are great if you have a problem
amazon	Red Beard	2012-02-17T22:42:53Z	4	Amazon is by far my favorite shopping site. Just because of convenience. But it's still a little annoying sometimes. I'm glad they updated their design and interface. So it's improving. I'm a Prime member and I'd recommend getting that.
amazon	Joan	2012-02-17T21:32:18Z	5	Have placed many orders with Amazon and have never been disappointed in service and quality of products.

amazon	sofia b.	2012-02-16T16:29:33Z	5	Hoping the quality of the service won't go down as the company goes up.

amazon	Janet	2012-02-16T05:57:21Z	5	I have always recived my items promtly and in some cases quicker than I expected. Only twice in all the years I have been ordering from Amazon have I not received goods ordered. Then I my money was refunded immediately without fuss.
amazon	Ivana	2012-02-16T03:14:17Z	5	I love Amazon and their free shipping on most of the items. I will be a customer forever.
amazon	Mohd Khairul Anwar	2012-02-16T01:04:23Z	5	At first,I quite not interested into buying things using internet services. My friend started to introduce me with amazon.co.uk to purchase things easily without needing me to go out and buy it. From time to time, i see that the thing which being brought by my friend from Amazon safely arrive on time. So, I decided to go for a try. For the first time in my life, I made a purchase for camera lenses Nikkor 55-200mm from Amazon. After clicking purchase and filling all of the details on my debit card, I suddenly feel bad because I taught that Amazon was a joke and hoax. Few days later, I receive a parcel and it was actually my Lenses !! It was safely arrived and being packed with good and secure condition.Since then, I keep on purchasing item from Amazon and feel that it is much more easier compared to walking to shop.Thank you Amazon :)
amazon	janet G - Scotland	2012-02-15T22:08:57Z	5	I have be buying from Amazon UK for many years & their service is excellent, their prices are very, very competitive & it is one online site that is totally secure, trust worthy & no hassle if a product might not be to your liking.  Their customer service staff are friendly, very helpful & I can highly recommend Amazon UK as my favourite online shopping venue:)))
amazon	Susan Lawson	2012-02-15T21:36:19Z	5	Efficient, reliable and very dependable. I always check with Amazon first before I look elsewhere.
amazon	Yuriy Tsalyy	2012-02-15T21:25:07Z	5	As for me, it's only one minus: I live in the Czech Republic, but Czech Amazon doesn't exist. It means, that I have additional spendings for delivery of Amazon parcels from Germany, UK, USA. And particularly for me not easy to buy on Amazon.de as I don't speak German.Beside it I haven't got any problem with Amazon.
amazon	Charlene	2012-02-15T20:26:04Z	5	Received defective product, they gave me a return label to send the item back!
amazon	Holly Stowell	2012-02-15T16:04:28Z	5	I always get my orders quickly and I love the variety on the Kindle Store.

Being a Prime Member give you some additional perks, such as access to their library of free movies and tv shows.

amazon	Michelle Hedges	2012-02-14T16:22:52Z	5	Look here first before you hit the shops, i have found so many bargins on amazon, and you dont always have to pay delivery which is even better.
amazon	Mrs Kay	2012-02-14T14:38:22Z	5	A great company!!! always been very happy, have had a few problems from other companies but Amazon have always sorted and make sure you are not out of pocket also I like the fact that they dont charge postage.
amazon	Mrs Wyatt	2012-02-14T12:44:12Z	1	The worst service i have ever had. Parcel 5 days late. Courier had no idea where the parcel was , as had amazon.
amazon	bosica	2012-02-14T12:27:15Z	5	So war all of my purchases and preorders went fine, and my country is supported. Good enough for me.
amazon	Mrs Susan Hocking	2012-02-14T08:31:33Z	5	Dont have a bad word to say about this company always excellent service
amazon	Jennifer	2012-02-14T01:37:21Z	5	The five stars is ONLY until next year (2013).  I am very disappointed Amazon buckled to California and will soon begin taxing us who order in California.  As though, our taxes are not enough as it is!  OMG!  I will have to shop around then I suppose.  Right now though, Amazon is our first stop when we begin shopping.  And we do MOST ALL our shopping on line.
amazon	Jack M	2012-02-13T20:26:49Z	5	Never had any problems with Amazon. Items arrive on time 99.9% of the time, the one time I did have to return an item (which wasn't to do with Amazon) I simply e-mailed them and they sent me the paperwork necessary to send it back and I got a full refund. Amazon is the first port of call whenever I need...well, anything.
amazon	john tz.	2012-02-13T16:17:44Z	5	amazing tool just like ebayhelps people
amazon	David Jarrold	2012-02-13T13:30:30Z	4	be careful if in Europe that supplier is also in European Union. If not you will have problems with customs and in respect of drugs may face further problems!

amazon	Art Walicki	2012-02-12T22:55:36Z	5	I have ordered numerous items over the YEARS and have NEVER been dis-appointed with the service. Is always consistent and the products are just as they are rated. Keep up the consistent service. Everything else pales in comparison. If it is available from Amazon it is almost always the best price and I know the fastest service.
amazon	Dan Peck	2012-02-12T21:43:42Z	4	Amazon always has the most products of any website but watch out for pricing differences. Often you can find the same product for significantly less on a manufacturer's website.
amazon	Customer Cat	2012-02-12T16:58:34Z	5	99 percent of the time I get what I want from this company
amazon	Katherine	2012-02-12T07:04:08Z	5	I have ordered many things at Amazon and I love their service and wide variety of items
amazon	Roslyn	2012-02-12T04:05:27Z	5	this product is awsome.
amazon	Bruno Bloch	2012-02-12T03:51:31Z	4	Rather than having to deal with the many issues you may face on eBay, Amazon offers good prices with a hassle free shopping/payment experience.Only downsides are the cluttered website and that products may sometimes be shipped from various companies rather than their central store.
amazon	kevin c.	2012-02-12T01:58:22Z	3	Free shipping is good
amazon	Customer	2012-02-11T21:07:29Z	5	Went to Amazon after 5 years buying and selling on E-bay. Really happy with Amazon Customer service -fast delivery, immediate refund if any problems, great communication. Great choice of everything. SSimple and secure payment method.

amazon	Kathy	2012-02-11T17:15:50Z	5	Everything is cheaper at Amazon.  Also, so state sales tax is great.
amazon	Mary	2012-02-11T16:57:10Z	5	I have had a relationship with Amazon from when it was first mentioned in the Wall Street Journal as a small startup company selling books.  Now I order something at least several times a month, usually more often.  It is my first shopping choice, whether online or off. Whenever I have had a question about something and have emailed them, I get a quick response.  I love the free shipping for orders over $25 so always take advantage of that.  Service is excellent.  Product always what it says it is.  As far as I am concerned, it started the online shopping and still is the best there is.
amazon	Clive Harris	2012-02-11T16:11:46Z	5	Highly recommend this company.
amazon	DAVID DICKINSON	2012-02-11T12:04:01Z	5	I use this as an alternative online ordering service and found it to be excellent and very professional.
amazon	VHB Plumbing Services	2012-02-11T11:11:58Z	5	I have to date been able to simply brouse and find what I require and download is so quick
amazon	Vicky K	2012-02-11T08:38:02Z	5	I have used Amazon a lot and have always found their service to be great, even when ordering items from Amazon Marketplace. They are always quick to respond if there are any queries or problems with the order. Items are always packaged well and usually arrive more quickly than the date range given when ordered.
amazon	D Martin	2012-02-10T17:14:19Z	5	My Kindle ebook reader developed a fault which I reported to Amazon at 5.30 in the afternoon.  A replacement was delivered by 8.30 the next morning!
amazon	Graham  Clarke	2012-02-10T14:50:51Z	5	All the items are in good quality when they arrive.very good service
amazon	Pia Sørensen	2012-02-10T09:43:37Z	4	I love the wide variety of books on Amazon, but i lately i haven't been able to find some the older books, that I was looking for. Maybe Amazon is becoming too broad?
amazon	Dr K	2012-02-09T23:49:49Z	5	Bought quite a few items from them recently and every time we get the items quickly and without problems. The one time, a while ago, that I did have an issue they sorted it quickly and efficiently.
amazon	Mrs PATRICIA NEALE	2012-02-09T19:39:15Z	5	I have always had fast service and everything has been as advertised
amazon	graham nicholson	2012-02-09T18:48:30Z	5	Very competitive prices. next day delivery. Regular order updates. great quslity service. what more can be said. perfect.
amazon	Julie Hunt	2012-02-09T15:55:27Z	5	Always found Amazon the best site for purchasing & selling of media ie c/ds dvd/s, software & games as well as books.Still the site to use for me on these purchases.
amazon	caitlin	2012-02-09T15:38:33Z	5	"Haven't had a bad experience yet with Amazon. Love their selection and it is one of my ""go to"" internet shopping options."
amazon	Gwendy Irwin	2012-02-09T08:45:40Z	5	Items direct from Amazon arrive in 2-3 days.
amazon	Mary	2012-02-09T01:48:25Z	4	what i DON'T LIKE IS ORDERING 25.00 AND THEN HAVE TO PAY S/P.
amazon	Donna Smith	2012-02-08T19:42:12Z	2	I have ordered items from Amazon that seem to take forever to arrive even though the item is in stock, had one item go missing in Nov 2011, which they did refund me for as I ended up buying the item elsewhere. I signed up for their prime service which was next day delivery, item took 7 days to get here, and when I enquired about this, my prime membership was extended by two months free beyond the one month free trial, having spoken to them on the phone they assured me they would extend it, but last week received an email saying that my free trial was over, and I no longer had the prime membership. Having spoken to other people in regards to Amazon's prime membership, I have come to realize it's nothing but a con from them. They have had numerous complaints about their delivery service and still have yet to address them.
amazon	Sean R McColgan	2012-02-08T19:36:02Z	5	Amazon has never failed me. Everything's timely, and the selection is always incredible. I hope to use only amazon in the future, simplifying my shopping experience.
amazon	Rae	2012-02-08T15:09:53Z	3	Reasonable prices on some products.Difficult to search. Would be nice if I could sort products in category by price+shipping to make selection easier.Pricing unclear in list: shipping costs not disclosed unless click on specific product.
amazon	grace	2012-02-08T09:06:35Z	3	love amazon although do not sell on market place im still waiting on funds !!!!
amazon	James	2012-02-08T03:46:06Z	5	Amazon has everything, gets it to you fast and coordinates shipments from multiple vendors. I wish their reviews and product info were more extensive, but that's a reflection of individual vendors. Shop around to find out what you want, then buy it (cheaper) at Amazon and get multiples items all at once.
amazon	Jim	2012-02-08T02:52:28Z	5	Perfect place to order online as 1.  Prices are very competitive2.  At least 25% of items qualify for free shipping if > order > $253.  With Prime, orders from Amazon ship 2 days free and no minimum order requiredMost of the time when adding shipping and state sales tax, other companies come out more expensive than Amazon.  I love the 1 stop shopping.
amazon	Gitty	2012-02-07T23:26:06Z	5	happy with service
amazon	alberto	2012-02-07T18:56:46Z	5	i use this alot and it truely is a place to get discounts on everything.

amazon	Mads Sandahl	2012-02-07T11:03:28Z	5	I can only recommend this shop. Bought a lot of items from amazon and if any small problems came up they could always assist!
amazon	Laurie Phillips	2012-02-07T09:24:34Z	4	AMAZON CLAIM TO BE THE MOST CUSTOMER CENTRIC COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND ON NEARLY ALL COUNTS CAN JUSTIFY THAT.REGRETTABLY THEY HAVE RECENTLY BLOTTED THEIR COPYBOOK IN A BIG WAY.   A FAULTY PRODUCT FROM A THIRD PARTY SUPPLIER WAS DEALT WITH VERY BADLY BY THE SUPPLIER AND AMAZON DID NOTHING AT ALL TO HELP.  THIS WAS I FELT A FAILURE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEIR COMMUNICATIONS IN DEALING WITH IT WERE THE LEAST CUSTOMER ORIENTED I HAVE RECEIVED IN A LONG TIME.  IF THEY WEREN'T SO GOOD GENERALLY I WOULD HAVE DOWNGRADED THEM FURTHER.
amazon	Windsordane	2012-02-07T07:36:52Z	5	By far the best internet retailer.  Almost a 1 stop shop on the net.
amazon	Adriana	2012-02-07T06:33:31Z	5	Life without Amazon.com - is it possible???  Not a single bad experience - reliable, great product diversity, easy to navigate menu, secure transactions - the list goes on.  Perfect!

amazon	Massimo	2012-02-06T07:08:43Z	5	I have used Amazon since 1997 and never had any troubles. What more?
amazon	Jasper Hound	2012-02-05T21:35:55Z	3	You'd think with how simple it is to buy on Amazon they'd implement a similar system for sellers. Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!I don't like buying from Amazon market place either. I generally only buy from Amazon themselves or sellers who are fulfilled by Amazon. Not good for Amazon sellers.
amazon	Mrs ANDREA MACDONALD	2012-02-05T19:59:49Z	5	First class service every time would recomend to any one.
amazon	Keith Gray	2012-02-05T19:07:07Z	5	Never had a problem with Amazon
amazon	Catherine Eustace	2012-02-05T17:42:37Z	5	Have ordered many things from Amazon and must say that they  are on the ball. Latest item was  from CurrentBody and what a superb product.   Great service all round.Thank you,

amazon	Tom	2012-02-04T20:05:31Z	5	Have been impressed with the many orders I have placed with amazon. Punctuality and great price. No quibble returns policy too. takes a lot of beating...
amazon	Customer Adele	2012-02-04T18:40:26Z	5	The range of goods and the sesrvice have always been good and I have not had any problems since I started using Amazon.
amazon	Kirsty	2012-02-04T14:30:16Z	5	I use amazon on a regular basis. The company sells many things at really good competitive prices.The postage is quick too. Thank you
amazon	Jay	2012-02-04T11:44:49Z	5	Excellent prices, delivery and customer service. But their website is a messy junk yard that is in need of an aesthetic overhaul.
amazon	Laura Vance	2012-02-04T05:51:58Z	4	I have ordered many things from Amazon and each time it's arrived on time and without any problems. All my holiday shopping was completed through Amazon and the Prime membership has MORE than paid for itself!

amazon	htsetr	2012-02-01T14:41:41Z	3	ordered stuff that took kinda long to arrive, and the shipping fee for an item is relatively high especially when they consider the item is 'special' with extra handling fee
amazon	Richard Turner	2012-02-01T09:11:45Z	4	They always go the extra mile
amazon	Tom Fitzherbert	2012-02-01T03:35:47Z	5	Been using Amazon since 1998. Very happy with shipping and return policy. Customers service (if you're unfortunate enough to need it) can be poor, but they're an online company so that's not unusual.My Prime account recently expired which has actually saved me a LOT of money. I realized I don't compulsively buy anymore, like when I had Prime.
amazon	Carol	2012-01-31T21:21:46Z	5	I love ordering from Amazon as they have almost anything you would want.  Prizes are great and delivery time is also.

amazon	Natalie	2012-01-30T20:03:11Z	5	If I can't find it on Amazon then I guess I didn't need it! Always the best price and most times no shipping
amazon	Aimee	2012-01-30T18:19:20Z	5	Got so many different things from this site I love it.
amazon	Vicki Connell	2012-01-30T13:08:54Z	5	Amazon are the best shopping experience ever. Their customer service is second to none and you can virtually buy anything from here and always at a cheaper price.
amazon	s j m	2012-01-30T11:23:53Z	5	bought the wife a kindle for christmas, she thinks its great, she was previously non conformist as far as technology went but now downloads her own books from amazon.com  well donw amazon

amazon	Ben Holmes	2012-01-30T00:43:11Z	5	I love amazon, if they sold everything I buy I'd buy everything from them. I receive things the next day even when I order at 8pm and on the rare occasion theres a problem their customer service is beyond excellent. Can't rate them highly enough.
amazon	janice dunlop	2012-01-29T22:35:09Z	4	Never had any problems with amazon. Use them a lot. Love the click and buy!
amazon	Jeremy	2012-01-29T20:40:34Z	5	Everytime i use amazon, they provide lightning fast service, from a 3 day delivery (using standard!), to a refund on a year old product. They just dont have any mercy for giving you a great experience.Easy to find what you want, tells you where its coming from, even gives you cheaper options of that product from other merchants. They have a lot of stuff too.Love you guys.
amazon	Debbie, Gizmo & Mikka	2012-01-29T16:55:24Z	5	"Fantastic customer service! Easy on-line ordering! Speedy delivery!

Debbie & Bob"
amazon	Adam Boalt	2012-01-29T13:28:58Z	5	I order almost everything from here.  Great customer service if you ever need to return something as well.
amazon	cheryl	2012-01-29T13:21:26Z	5	I absolutely LOVE  Amazon!!  It keeps getting better all the time.  Amazon almost always has what I am looking for and comes with reviews.  With all there is to choose from - it is so beneficial to be able to read what other people have to say about the products!!  And, I love that Amazon has Prime shipping - it has paid for itself over and over again.  When I have had a problem - the return process couldn't be easier.
amazon	Bob the Gas	2012-01-29T11:49:09Z	5	Never been disapointed.
amazon	Stephen Richards	2012-01-29T10:55:04Z	3	Like many people I have used Amazon quite often over the years and although the service is generally quite good, delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off peak periods. I cannot fault however the downloads, especially the ebooks. Fast, efficient, simple!
amazon	Multiple Pet Owner Cynthia	2012-01-29T05:10:26Z	5	Use all the time for purchasing books and movies - great resource - find other things - just about anything you can imagine here!
amazon	FunkyJive	2012-01-29T01:56:24Z	5	Over the years I have spent thousands of pounds at Amazon.Puchasing from distance sellers is often a leap of faith - but not with Amazon. Should I be looking for high-value items I need to know that the supplier can be trusted to honour their commitments and service promises. Never once have I had a single bad experience or cause for complaint, and for this reason alone I am happy to forego reasonable price fluctuations with occasionally lower prices elsewhere as I know that I'll not be left high-and-dry with a problem.Basically, Amazon have got it right and afford their customers with the consideration and respect that is reflected in their deeds and service policy. For this reason, Amazon will get my preferential loyal custom for as long as their exemplary service continues.
amazon	D S GRAY	2012-01-28T19:32:31Z	5	It has got to be one of the biggest and best on line stores to deal with. Very helpful and polite.Superfast delivery on all items.A guaranteed all round winner.
amazon	Amanda	2012-01-28T16:05:47Z	5	i love amazon i know a lot of people who use and love it to. i would recommend this site to anyone because how easy it is to navigate around and find what you want or just finding ideas.
amazon	Daniel Michael Pridie	2012-01-28T07:52:40Z	5	they have everything i needed for a bathroom remodel.
amazon	jennifer	2012-01-27T22:13:36Z	4	Good prices but customer service only accepts emails..overall fast shippjng and good prices.  If amazon has better customer service.  It would be a five star company.
amazon	Stef	2012-01-27T18:45:29Z	5	I ordered a book for Christmas but it has never been delivered. I complained and Amazon immediately refunded me back. I had to go and buy another present but I appreciate the speed of their response!
amazon	BelbriOrganics	2012-01-27T18:05:42Z	4	Amazon has come a long way ever since its inception with limited BOOKS and few other products on sale and web searchable.  Now the story has changed for the better and excellent service with wide variety of products to choose from, the range on offer goes on and on.  Good on you Amazon, keep up the good work!
amazon	HorshamLass	2012-01-27T15:38:40Z	5	Now in this day and age who or what could you honestly say that about?  From cat food to Le Creuset pots I have bought the lot and the service has been superb.Well done Amazon.
amazon	mark	2012-01-27T15:18:07Z	5	but not so good when u go all the way to checkout then get told theres a payment eror when all details are corect.stil havent got to the bottum ov this

amazon	sreleti	2012-01-26T13:27:28Z	5	Keep up the good work
amazon	Josh Baddley	2012-01-26T03:53:20Z	5	Best site for electronics, hands down. Best Buy blows in comparison. Their Subscribe and Save program has potential but needs more products. I've been a Prime subscriber for a few years and I've never regretted it.
amazon	Tania	2012-01-26T01:42:13Z	5	Amazon has terrific pricing, often the best around, especially if you have Amazon Prime. I received the items quickly, any concerns I voice are handled promptly and to my satisfaction.
amazon	Philip	2012-01-25T20:59:54Z	5	my only criticism of amazon is that the items location is not readillyavailable when ordering. I avoid buying directly from HK as items can sometimes take an eternity to arrive
amazon	Pamela	2012-01-25T19:58:48Z	5	I use Amazon primarily for shopping.  I love the ability to choose between images and product.  Service is always quick and reliable.  I do wish it were easier to move from an image to the website where the image can be located, and then move back again.  That is the only criticism I had of the site.
amazon	Bob Taylor	2012-01-25T19:06:40Z	4	They really helped me in getting the order which had simply been lost in post --great service
amazon	Maxine Robinson	2012-01-25T09:20:48Z	5	I always go to amazon first if i need to buy anything and nearly always find it on their site.
amazon	Lisa	2012-01-25T06:19:23Z	5	I find that it offers a wide array of products at mostly cheaper prices. I do not purchase anything online without double checking Amazon first. I've yet to have any issues personally but others that I know claim that it is just about the best when it comes to resolving them, and keeping the customers happy.
amazon	Frankie B	2012-01-24T23:43:11Z	5	Products are accurately described, very competitively priced, postage is invariably free and delivery is usually made within a few days.
amazon	gareth	2012-01-24T22:54:02Z	5	first class company. i've ordered many items from blu rays to av recievers. never had a problem.
amazon	Bryce	2012-01-24T22:53:55Z	3	"I typically have good experiences with amazon, but my last few orders have been a sub-par experience. They're just such a big company that you feel like you get lost in the system. There is no ""one-on-one"" type feeling when you call them. You're just another number."
amazon	faith	2012-01-24T18:55:56Z	5	always find what i need on amazon at reasonable prices.
amazon	charlie h	2012-01-24T18:29:02Z	4	always good service......but sometimes hard to find the products
amazon	amanda	2012-01-24T18:21:56Z	5	never had a problem with any items ordered , kindle customer service was great.
amazon	paul	2012-01-24T17:21:35Z	4	Amazon is my 'go to' side when I realise I've forgotten someones birthday. Never fails to come up with some good gift ideas, and quick delivery wherever I've sent stuff.
amazon	adamwilkins	2012-01-24T17:11:17Z	5	This company always deliver when promised.
amazon	Christine	2012-01-24T16:51:07Z	5	ALWAYS easy, always fast, always terrific communication and great packaging (even when dealing with companies who sell through them).
amazon	Yolonda	2012-01-24T15:57:02Z	5	Lots of products, great prices, fast shipping.
amazon	Dawid	2012-01-24T15:43:02Z	5	They have what i look for at low prices and the delivery has never let me down.
amazon	bunny	2012-01-24T15:21:32Z	4	Every time I have called Amazon for issues on the phone, they have been extremely pleasant and helpful. My kindle wasn't working and they sent me a new one with no hassles.
amazon	HappyCustomer;)	2012-01-24T14:54:29Z	2	Could be a lot better than it is.
amazon	Tobin	2012-01-24T04:17:57Z	3	You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(
amazon	Zachary Green	2012-01-23T23:29:49Z	4	Love the 2 day shipping and great customer service.
amazon	Steven Shostakovich	2012-01-23T21:58:20Z	5	Never had a bad time with these guys. Good selection, accurate delivery times, good condition and timely arrivals. Can't be faulted. On the two times I've had to talk to a customer support person they proved pretty up to the task too.
amazon	Helen	2012-01-23T16:38:50Z	5	Always receive my products. Have always had great service. One time I wanted to return a product for a refund(it just wasn't what I needed). They said NOT to return the product and gave me a refund that day. It was only $12 but I think that's great work. Great job Amazon!!
amazon	Lisa	2012-01-23T15:28:13Z	4	Generally excellent service - just make sure you check the Free Super Saver Delivery if you want free delivery.  The default is to pay for delivery.  Also be aware of returns costs - the cost of return can outweigh the refund you will receive, as I discovered when I mistakenly ordered 72 incorrect cartridges for my son's toy gun!
amazon	Robbie	2012-01-23T11:04:08Z	5	This is a great company, reasonably priced products, good servicelots of shoes, (I love shoes ) and free Kindle books, what more could you want.J Robinson
amazon	FunkyDiva1	2012-01-22T16:57:51Z	5	I love Amazon! I did all my christmas shopping on here and saved £'s and £'s

amazon	Carolyn Southwell	2012-01-22T08:38:05Z	3	A good site but have had my card details hacked into twice!
amazon	Mr T Steels	2012-01-21T21:50:29Z	5	I have had several items from Amazon - all arrived quickly and the one item I received which was broken in the post was quickly replaced.The Kindle service is superb and the Kindle Support can't be faulted.An easy to find contact email address would be a bonus.I will continue to use Amazon because of the service I have received.
amazon	IAN FRASER-WARD	2012-01-21T20:55:02Z	4	Products are good as well as the price. Some products take a little longer to arrive but you are kept well informed by E-Mail of arrival dates
amazon	martin stubbs	2012-01-21T20:54:29Z	3	Great place to search for products and see what's available but the website needs filters to help your search - such as price filters to make searching for items easierGreat that they offer free postage on a wide range of items and give discount if u buy a certain item regularly by opting to subscribe. This gives an even better price
amazon	Robbie Blume	2012-01-21T18:42:59Z	5	I love the free shipping and great prices on Amazon!
amazon	Letsbehonest	2012-01-21T18:02:29Z	5	If you're looking for the best role model for an online business, Amazon is it.   Great products at great prices, and excellent customer service.
amazon	Leonard	2012-01-21T15:23:37Z	5	Awesome company!!!
amazon	Sandra	2012-01-21T15:12:55Z	4	Small replacement items like vacume filters are almost always difficult to find in a rural local area.  This site is a god send for those kinds of things.
amazon	Sarah	2012-01-21T15:12:35Z	5	No matter what I am looking for Amazon has it and if I have a problem with a seller they handle it!
amazon	JLow	2012-01-21T13:58:44Z	5	Never had a problem with these guys & always reliable!

amazon	Ela	2012-01-21T11:01:45Z	5	great company, never had any problems returning any items or problems with delivery, thanks
amazon	Robert Killington	2012-01-21T10:39:59Z	5	Usually everything goes well. When things go wrong, and they do, the best suppliers put things right quickly and easily. Amazon is in this category. I've bought lots of stuff through Amazon and I keep going back!
amazon	Bernard Osbaldiston	2012-01-21T10:31:42Z	5	In all the orders I have placed with Amazon I have never had a single problem. excellent company to deal with. This is the standard all companies should aim to achieve.
amazon	Sharon Loken	2012-01-21T05:57:28Z	5	Looking for a great buy - honest oponion - store to puchase something - and most everything else ...  GO TO AMAZON.  They have straight forth products and best purchasing advice around.  Thanks Amazon for your outstanding quality.
amazon	Joshua	2012-01-21T04:53:31Z	5	Before I shop anywhere else whether it be in-store or online I always check Amazon first, second, and last.  I am an Amazon Prime member and it is worth every penny.
amazon	Diana	2012-01-20T16:15:11Z	4	"A few nights ago I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrific thirst for...........ginger beer!I pulled out my trusty iPad and opened the Amazon app.  I entered ""ginger beer"" and there were dozens of choices.  I chose one that sounded good and ordered a 24 pk.  Two days later it was sitting on my front porch.  And free shipping thru Amazon Prime.I find that just a little bit amazing.HOWEVER.  There is an Amazon shipping plant near my home and the word is out that it is a total sweat shop.  Hearing that has made me love Amazon a lot less.  Wake up, Amazon.  The most successful companies are the ones who treat their employees like the assets they are."
amazon	hellena f	2012-01-20T16:08:51Z	5	it's one of the most trusted websites out there. why are we even reviewing it?
amazon	B.Rock	2012-01-20T15:59:19Z	4	Great site. Deliverers exactly what you order.
amazon	Mr	2012-01-20T10:51:40Z	5	Reliable, get what you order, no problems
amazon	Ellis Alden	2012-01-20T10:50:03Z	5	I use Amazon a lot as I find their prices VERY competitive and their free delivery often fast as well.However where they really stand out is in customer service.Twice,products I have received,have become faulty in a short space of time and,with no hassle using the Amazon automated returns system,they have been replaced at no cost to me.Both times it took minimal effort on my part.I heartily recommend this firm.
amazon	Ann Tong	2012-01-20T07:38:42Z	5	Can find anything in Amazon. Use it as a base for price checking. Will be good if there is some points reward system. The more you order the more reward points you have for future purchase.
amazon	DAWN	2012-01-20T03:51:41Z	5	THERES NOT ONE BAD THING TO SAY! ALL IS GREAT!OH...EXCEPT SOME OF THEIR RD PARTY SELLERS ARE...WELL..JUST SAY..THEY ARE...NOT...AMAZON! IF A PROBLEM WITH THE 3RD PARTY AMAZON DOES ALL...THEY CAN TO HELP!
amazon	Sharon Lawson Waldron	2012-01-20T03:42:47Z	5	Nothing like getting a few new books to add to my e-reader.
amazon	Shawna	2012-01-19T22:41:27Z	5	I love the fact that I can buy anything on Amazon!  They have helped me when a company sent me an inferior product that I bought through them and have allowed me to sell my own products.
amazon	Linda	2012-01-19T21:11:11Z	5	I have bought pots'n'pans, books, kitchenware and shelving through Amazon....they are fast and reliable!  A go to site for all my wants!
amazon	Sherri Kobel	2012-01-19T20:41:16Z	5	When I shop on line, Amazon is the first place I go to.  The variety is fantastic.  The Prime shipping option is outstanding.  I purchase many of my groceries from Amazon using Prime shipping.  Whenever I've had a problem, their customer service has been very accomodating, as well as promt with their accomodation.  I have been a faithful customer for 5 years and have been happy the whole time.
amazon	Peter Risley	2012-01-19T19:31:06Z	5	Brilliant as always

amazon	Tbirdspinner	2012-01-18T18:38:05Z	5	No more dumping bags at jumble sales.  Whole new source of income in hard times, reselling kids books and DVDs that are grown out of, then having funds to buy the next challenge (Just Dance 3 for mum to work out to).  Thank you for making it easy.
amazon	Vicky Weston	2012-01-18T12:22:59Z	4	I've used Amazon on a number of occasions and have always been happy with the service I received. I find the website very user friendly and hassle free. Would certainly recommend.
amazon	Maureen McAulay	2012-01-18T12:13:02Z	5	Great service good quality items use them all the time for mostly everything i buy.
amazon	Vesile Halil	2012-01-18T10:24:38Z	5	Always up to standards, quick delivery of quality products also wide range.
amazon	Hasnat Ahmed	2012-01-18T09:14:41Z	4	Very happy with the service so far and would recommend. One area that needs to be improved is the transparency and clarity of ancillary chargeable such as tax. Have been caught with this at the last moment of paying when the total price came unexpectedly to very large figure and it would have been very easy to complete the order if attention lapsed slightly. Very important.
amazon	Susan	2012-01-18T08:20:40Z	5	Amazon never lets me down - perfect
amazon	Somerset Stephen	2012-01-17T22:21:20Z	5	Amazon has a vast selection of products at great prices and is very easy to navigate. The one click option is great.  My only reservation is the seller rating system as one seller offered me money to remove a critical review, which left me doubting the overall validity of the rating system. I informed Amazon by email but had no reply.
amazon	Katrina Kovach	2012-01-17T21:50:10Z	5	fast service good products and fast shipping.
amazon	Isoro	2012-01-17T20:37:24Z	5	"Have ordered numerous items thru amazon.com, never a problem.  On one occasion, submitted order with routine shipping....received the item the next day!  Ordering books on their kindle is easy, and when I have ordered ""future"" books, always delivered on the date promised."
amazon	nillabop	2012-01-17T19:59:29Z	5	Everyone has their favorite shopping sites, but I'm an Amazon lover for life.  Every time I want to buy something, I check that site first for prices and especially for reviews.  In the years I've been shopping on Amazon I've only had a few problems, but they were taken care of right away and to my complete satisfaction.  I just LOVE Amazon!!!

amazon	carli	2012-01-14T16:43:37Z	5	One stop shop where I can get anything I need with a tap of a mouse. And if I'm having trouble making a decision on purchase the reviews are always spot on.
amazon	Mrs J Williams	2012-01-14T15:59:56Z	5	I received a kindle for christmas so I use this site to buy my online books,it is set up just for your personal choice,gives you recommendations and reviews of latest books. I find the site very easy to use and have never had any problems when I have bought previous electronic goods,and even found a last minute panic buy of a fancy dress outfit for my daughters nativity play,(which was cheaper than the ebay version!) I recommend this site to all my friends and family,keep up the good work!
amazon	Mrs Margaret Lynn Ingledew	2012-01-14T09:57:01Z	5	I have recently bought a Kindle and the choice and ease of downloading ebooks is amazing and very fast.We also use Amazon for a variety of goods and been very pleased both with price and fast delivery.
amazon	Sam Wagener	2012-01-14T05:46:11Z	5	Well done amazon.
amazon	Customer	2012-01-13T22:54:43Z	5	I became an Amazon Prome customer last year WOW what a service well worth the cost.When i make a mistake or something goes wrong the customer service at Amazon is first class all the way.My first place to shop no is Amazon.
amazon	Paul Wehr	2012-01-13T20:35:22Z	5	Nothing better
amazon	James Stephens	2012-01-13T13:13:42Z	5	I have nothing but praise for Amazon.  They are efficient and easy to shop with.  On the couple of occasions where I've had a problem or needed to return an item they couldn't have been more helpful - their returns system is simple, straightforward and works well.  I subscribe to Amazon Prime as a regular shopper, it's well worth paying for, particularly since other members of your household can get free delivery under the one subscription.Amazon are a modern company who've got it right and set a good example for the standard required of online shopping.
amazon	Craig R	2012-01-12T21:56:26Z	5	Best price on the web time after time
amazon	Andy	2012-01-12T20:13:53Z	5	Amazon is great and offers excellent deals too!
amazon	June Sharp	2012-01-12T17:41:42Z	5	I bought all my family's Christmas presents from their Amazon wish lists, so quick & easy!
amazon	cheryl	2012-01-11T22:26:42Z	5	I got this as a christmas gift in 2010 and it has been one of the best gifts ever. I wasn't sure I could give up paper books but it is so convenient, I've read more than I would have done.With the free books, I've also read stuff that I wouldn't have done otherwise and thoroughly enjoyed it.Can't recommend it highly enough.Improvements could be made by having and illuminated screen which I like when reading my kindle books on an ipad.
amazon	Fran	2012-01-11T20:03:41Z	5	Good choice, excellent delivery times, I' d recommend them to anyone (and often do!!)
amazon	Henry	2012-01-11T16:38:46Z	5	Whenever I need something, I look on Amazon as my first source. The prices are highly competitive, and I am always shocked when I see something priced higher on Amazon than somewhere else. It is hard to rate them on shipping, as some items don't ship directly from them, but as I am a member of Amazon Prime, I can attest to the fact that their 2 day shipping is indeed 2 day shipping (and sometimes, it's even 1 day shipping!).
amazon	kim	2012-01-11T15:11:05Z	3	ive had on the whole a very pleasant experience with amazon. I have recommended it to friends

amazon	russ rhodes	2012-01-10T20:45:27Z	5	I have spent 100s of dollars with Amazon.  They have great service, great return policies, great prices and in most cases, free shipping.  Love this company!
amazon	Clubmeber	2012-01-10T19:53:38Z	4	Amazon delivers what you'd expect it to - The best deals around the internet of almost anything you think you want to buy. A good layout design, easy to get used to.
amazon	VASILIKI - Greece	2012-01-10T19:18:25Z	5	I just love it!I mainly use it to order books
amazon	Angelo	2012-01-10T13:56:14Z	5	I am a customer of Amazon.com since more than 15 years. Over time, I have placed a lot of orders, and they always managed things competently and reliably. For instance, when I (as usual) ordered many items together, they sent the items in separate shipments as soon as they become available, often making more than one shipment, and they did not increase the cost (i.e., I paid for one shipment only). Things were always well packaged and everything arrived in good order. I never had even minor problems or issues with this company, and I definitely recommend it.
amazon	Rob Deeming	2012-01-10T13:24:32Z	4	Amazon is really a benchmark retail site - great availability, lots of options, and incredibly easy to initiate and complete and purchase.I don't think any other site makes it as easy to quickly choose different delivery addresses, billing addresses and payment options.Now they need to work on their horrific user interface!
amazon	Phil Hopkins	2012-01-10T11:38:20Z	5	nice site to grab items from a list of trusted vendors.
amazon	Patricia	2012-01-09T21:58:31Z	5	If you cannot find it at Amazon.com then you probably don't need it!
amazon	staceybarber	2012-01-09T17:12:15Z	5	Have bought loads from amazon and always delivered really fast and great prices. Is 1st place I check for things now
amazon	CGosden	2012-01-09T14:56:43Z	5	Nearly always surprised by incredibly prompt delivery - and excellent communication when items delayed for any reason.  Good service on the odd occasions when I've had to return items. Sometimes tempted by cheaper prices to use another website, but usually regret my decision!
amazon	IN	2012-01-08T17:13:49Z	5	And I mean everything - reliable, good deals, the whole package.
amazon	Sue And Her Zoo	2012-01-08T15:50:07Z	5	There is nothing you can't find on Amazon, the prices are great, and the delivery is amazingly fast.   My first choice for ordering online.
amazon	Irene T Grierson	2012-01-08T11:57:32Z	5	I am always very pleased with Amazon and shop here often
amazon	Chris Topley	2012-01-07T20:10:12Z	5	Amazon continue to lead where others follow with first rate service.  Items arrive when promised and are extremely well packaged.  Just about everyone else on the Internet could learn from their organisational skills.
amazon	Sandy Weed	2012-01-07T18:57:44Z	5	I have been very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. The prices are very reasonable and they have great sale prices as well. Most of the time the shipping time stated and the actual arrival of my orders has been two days ahead of time stated. Very pleased and plan to order more from them in the future.
amazon	D Gallacher	2012-01-06T22:28:08Z	5	Amazing Amazon. Trustworthy, user friendly site. Speedy relaible service. Highly recommended.

amazon	Dave	2012-01-05T22:14:52Z	5	I absolutely love Amazon. They've been a very reliable hub to shop from, with absolutely no problems in anything I've purchased on their site (from the company itself nor the independent merchants). I've bought books, computer hardware, games, music, jewelery, guitar accessories, and clothes from Amazon, and everything has been top notch service. Delivery estimates either exactly when they say, or my items arrived earlier than expected, and well packaged.
amazon	Edith Driban	2012-01-05T16:52:36Z	5	I buy quite a bit from Amazon and have always been satisfied with the quality of their service.
amazon	Dawn	2012-01-05T02:53:53Z	5	I have become quite addicted to Amazon.com this year. I love its sale prices, its choices, and its very fast delivery service. I have reccommended it to all of my friends.
amazon	Lisa	2012-01-05T02:35:55Z	5	Items always arrive on time and often earlier than expected!  Selection is great and so are the prices.  Amazon Prime membership makes two-day shipping free and I LOVE that!
amazon	Uncle Buckworth	2012-01-04T21:14:35Z	5	Outstanding customer service
amazon	Terry Sullivan	2012-01-04T17:13:58Z	5	There is nothing this company can't seem to find or supply and at a highly competitive price!
amazon	Teresa	2012-01-03T21:49:08Z	5	I received my order very quickly and accurately. I will absolutely use Amazon again.
amazon	Martin Reynolds	2012-01-03T21:44:07Z	5	had to return an item (my fault) and the service was outstanding.highly recommended
amazon	Graham Perry	2012-01-03T20:26:52Z	5	very reliable service fast delivery
amazon	Nicola	2012-01-03T12:12:48Z	5	I have used Amazon for a couple of years now and over all that time and many many orders, i have never once been dissappointed!  The purchasing process is simple and quick, the delivery times are accurate and almost always arrive before expected which is a bonus at xmas!  The offer of free supersaver delivery is just fantastic and since purchasing a kindle from Amazon i have been really impressed with how it works and just how lightening quick books etc are downloaded within seconds!  This company is worth its weight in gold.  I have yet to try the selling side of Amazon but i think i am sure this will also be a straightforward no-fuss procedure also!  Will continue to use this company long into the future!
amazon	Debbie	2012-01-03T11:48:41Z	5	Bought from Amazon regular and never had an issue with anything.
amazon	Rich from S. F.	2012-01-02T19:29:58Z	5	I've been buying most of my clothing from Big Tall Direct for years and have never had a bad experience.  Their Customer Service, selection and pricing are excellent.I recommend this company highly with absolutely no reservations.
amazon	Jim	2012-01-02T18:52:03Z	5	EXTREMELY impressed with the customer service and prompt shipping. Product was as described and I even got a coupon code online with a bigger discount. Order five days before Christmas and received before Christmas. My wife was so excited.I saw so many bad reviews and almost didn't order but I am so happy I gave Amiclubwear a fair chance because they exceeded my expectations. My order # was 100210831 if anyone doubts me. Thank you Amiclub for such great prompt service.forever loyal customer,Jim
amazon	Michael	2012-01-02T16:18:00Z	4	But it makes you wonder who you're buying th products from. I know it tells you who will be selling the product to you, but aside from Amazon, I can't trust anyone else.
amazon	Customer	2012-01-02T14:31:19Z	5	i always check with Amazon first before buying from any where else, as their site is so easy to navigate through and they always have great prices and service.
amazon	Kayode Olorunfemi	2012-01-02T10:36:31Z	5	Still has the best customer service for peace of mind.
amazon	Miguel Gonzalez	2012-01-01T13:12:38Z	5	Fast, chip and reliable
amazon	Anthony	2011-12-30T16:23:59Z	5	I purchased all of my Christmas present from Amazon this year saving my self a large amount of money, time and effort and all my orders were delivered before Christmas. I hate shopping so will always look for a service that takes away the need to vie for articles I want on the high street.
amazon	Robert Smith	2011-12-29T21:28:17Z	5	Worth every penny as all my Christmas presents come on time every year thanks to this service.
amazon	Customer ROBERT RIDDINGTON	2011-12-29T17:52:23Z	1	Have stopped my account with Amazon. Had a very poor experience with one of their suppliers : - Premier Products.  I am sure they do not  check the people who supply goods for them. Cost me a lot of time and upset.
amazon	Akshay Mehta	2011-12-29T12:56:27Z	5	I buy from them very often, no complaints in the past few years.
amazon	Justin Anderson	2011-12-29T12:07:10Z	5	Without Amazon, Christmas would have been a whole lot harder this year. All items arrived on time, with an additional month of Prime membership offered for an item that came a day later than promised. Superb organisation!
amazon	Carmen	2011-12-29T03:16:29Z	4	Haven't had a problem yet!!
amazon	MARY	2011-12-29T00:04:16Z	5	Did most of my Christmas shopping this year on this site.  Very satisfied!
amazon	Kelly	2011-12-28T20:53:28Z	5	Everything I have gotten has been great, priced nicely, and delivered quickly.
amazon	Alan	2011-12-28T17:57:48Z	5	A good company with delivery options that will please anyone
amazon	gattula	2011-12-28T13:16:26Z	5	great price and fast delivery!
amazon	David Phillimore	2011-12-28T09:32:18Z	5	Usually the service is excellent and very quick. On the few occasions where there has been a problem Amazon have been quick to sort it out.
amazon	Ed	2011-12-27T07:52:03Z	1	I placed an order with amazon only to have it damaged in shipping.  UPS sent it back to amazon.  They never contacted me relating to the order at all.  There was a Xmas present in the order and it was due prior to Xmas.  When I finally was able to get a hold of Customer service they told me that I had to re-do the entire order and I would be refunded for the first order within 4 weeks or I could just get a refund for the entire order in 4 weeks... They would not just replace the order and send me replacements..  Poor policies.  Non communication of lost shipments and they like to hang onto your money for a long time.  Very bad customer service.  This was my first time ever buying from them and it is now my last.  I will also be telling my friends about the poor service and making sure that I have them make their purchases elsewhere online.
amazon	Guest	2011-12-26T21:41:33Z	5	Must admit most of the items I purchase from Amazon are books; craft books mostly.  I have never found a book I wanted cheaper elsewhere.  I always go for the free delivery option.  Amazon has never let me down...
amazon	FarFromTheMall	2011-12-26T16:38:29Z	5	I have been shopping for years with Amazon and have always felt confident because I know they stand behind their sales.   Every time I have had a customer care situation come up (infrequent and so far problems with product, not mistakes on Amazons part), Amazon has resolved the situation in my favor within 10 minutes on the phone.  This Christmas season was no exception.  I had an issue with some power equipment I bought for my husband.  Amazon resolved the issue while I was still in my PJs sitting next to the tree.  Not standing in the return line at a box store - priceless! Amazon gets the bulk of my business and it is because their prices are great and the customer service from Amazon is really outstanding.  The free shipping is just icing on the cake!
amazon	Helen Penney	2011-12-26T07:29:19Z	5	I always find what I am looking for, only disappointment is when purchase comes from outside seller rather than themselves - they can be very slow to receive in the latter's case.
amazon	Michael Collier	2011-12-25T20:00:15Z	5	Always deliver on time
amazon	John Millar	2011-12-25T13:10:58Z	1	Bought a plasma TV for £1250. Arrived cracked from side to side. Amazon refused to do anything, even honour its explicit guarantee, because it was a marketplace item, and they claimed no responibility. It took 18 months of court proceeding, which I won in full, to get a refund. Tried every trick of the book to get out of it, inlcuding claiming Amazon UK was not subject to the jurisdiction of the English Courts.
amazon	MARIA	2011-12-24T12:29:16Z	5	i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early
amazon	Customer johnny b	2011-12-23T22:13:51Z	5	always get what i order ..it arrives when it shouldand packaged properly

amazon	Rita RAYNAUD	2011-12-23T18:55:42Z	5	I am using Amazon since many years and their service and custumer care is excellent
amazon	Customer Mrs Val Smith	2011-12-23T18:07:27Z	5	Always excellent service and on the rare occasion I had to return something I was refunded very quickly.

amazon	Mrs Sarah Butter	2011-12-22T10:29:52Z	5	I always manage to find the item I am looking for on Amazon and at the best price. The delivery is usually free and prompt and I would not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone.
amazon	Gerald	2011-12-22T06:28:30Z	5	I recently purchased wall posters from Amazon. Good price and stuff got delivered in 3 days. Great website to buy almost anything.
amazon	Joseph Rawlinson	2011-12-22T05:57:48Z	5	"Amazon was the only place listing Scrooged (that I could find at the time) and so I ordered it immediately and it came within 2 weeks (from America).Also purchased MP3s recently and they have a ""we call you"" service which was fantastic and resolved my issue immediately."
amazon	Anonymous	2011-12-21T21:43:01Z	5	Great prices, free p+p, quick service, refunds accepted. What more could you ask for when shopping online?!
amazon	Mike Wade	2011-12-21T18:38:50Z	5	I have bought over a hundred items from amazon over the past ten years - they have always delivered the goods - literally and metaphorically. It's simply my first port of call for pretty much everything - not least because the product reviews are invaluable in making purchase decisions.
amazon	mrs whitehouse	2011-12-21T09:07:21Z	4	Not had any problems when dealing with Amazon this year.  Had a problem a couple of years ago with a tv I bought, but Amazon were fantastic and monitored all the emails back and forward between the company I bought the tv from and I got my money back.  Have every confidence when buying through Amazon.
amazon	Reggie Wild	2011-12-19T04:59:33Z	4	Over all this is a good site, a lot less chance than getting a snide copy or fake than E-bay. And also has a good price guide to toy with, format for the site is well done as well  A SMOOTH SHOPPING TIME ALL ROUND
amazon	r	2011-12-18T01:06:50Z	5	happy with the site
amazon	Mark Burton	2011-12-18T00:34:19Z	5	Great service and some great deals too!
amazon	Cecily Shea Smith	2011-12-17T21:49:05Z	3	I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th. I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.
amazon	John Frick	2011-12-17T18:23:08Z	5	they just have everything - delivery is fast returns are great like them alot
amazon	Ashley Dean	2011-12-17T13:35:21Z	4	Great company to deal with!
amazon	Mr B Duxbury	2011-12-17T11:55:12Z	5	i ordered rigid pipe cutter and assume it came from usa, they were delivered 3 days earlier than stated  great service.
amazon	Judy Wilson	2011-12-17T00:02:44Z	5	Amazon have never let me down - the service is beyond reproach as far as I am concerned!
amazon	Lewis	2011-12-16T22:27:45Z	5	I have used amazong for a good few years - mainly books. The prices are unbeatable and the quality of service is great!
amazon	Daniel	2011-12-16T21:12:04Z	5	I use amazon all the time!  Makes shopping online so easy!  I have prime and it gives me free 2day shipping!!
amazon	Ronnie Irvine	2011-12-16T19:22:12Z	4	I have never had any problems with Amazon either as a buyer or seller.
amazon	Mrs Valerie Wenham	2011-12-16T10:14:23Z	5	Always dependable, speedy, reasonable pricing - may they continue for my lifetime - says she selfishly!
amazon	Shrikrishna	2011-12-16T10:06:41Z	1	I returned an item expecting a refund. The Item was sent back to me with no explanation whatsoever. I had to contact them to ask for an explanation, which turned out to be that a return of softwear item was not acceptable. I responded with 'I won't do any business with you again'. I don't think that made any impact.
amazon	Irene Dolla	2011-12-16T09:01:28Z	5	I buy often from this store.. I love it..
amazon	Lawrence Whiting	2011-12-16T03:54:36Z	5	I don't buy a lot of stuff from Amazon but I have always found the product information up to date. I know if it is in stock, and when it is shipped, and they deliver to my PO Box which is great for a busy person like myself.
amazon	Jeanne Brynie	2011-12-15T17:17:08Z	5	Whatever you want, you are likely to find through Amazon.com.  The prices are reasonable and the service fast and efficient.
amazon	Sue	2011-12-13T18:36:33Z	5	You get exactly what it says on the screen
amazon	Rai	2011-12-13T11:38:14Z	5	Best place to buy anything
amazon	Mr John Roberts	2011-12-13T09:42:49Z	5	Used to be poor service and couldn't care less attitude but they've totally turned themselves around and are now THE place to shop online.
amazon	Tari	2011-12-13T04:57:12Z	4	I make a fair amount of orders from Amazon because their prices are very competitive and the delivery time is always quick. Even when you order from a third party and there are problems Amazon help you step in and deal with it.I deducted one star just because of the high shipping cost for many of the third party suppliers on the site. I think Amazon can do more to supply the items themselves and reduce the 3rd party input to the site.
amazon	Jim Stark	2011-12-13T02:58:38Z	5	I have ordered several books from Amazon. They were shipped promply and received in perfect condition. I will use the again.
amazon	Marc Crockatt	2011-12-12T17:24:21Z	3	Generally a good website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally delivery is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal delivery), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong.My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.
amazon	mmm	2011-12-12T15:06:36Z	4	good service
amazon	lddw3636	2011-12-12T09:23:31Z	5	Always reliable - that's what counts.
amazon	Peter Jeeves	2011-12-12T07:30:31Z	5	Amazon are a great site and can always find what I need and generally are cheaper than their nearest rival
amazon	C Allmark	2011-12-11T22:20:40Z	5	so much stuff to choose from u can always find what you want and usually for cheaper than everywhere else
amazon	Carol	2011-12-11T12:53:32Z	5	Highly recommended, so much more than just books as it was when it started.  What ever you are looking for, its worth checking them out and they are usually excellent on price.This is a company I feel safe ordering from, both that they will not share my details, payment is secure and if I have a complaint it is given immediate attention.They sell things from other small internet companies that I would not normally deal with because of the lack of knowledge and trust of them.  When buying through Amazon however, I can do so safely and without fear.And on the lighter side - how could I now exist without my Kindle?
amazon	Mrs Clare Heaton	2011-12-11T10:17:24Z	5	When a camera I had ordered malfunctioned after a week, I contacted amazon who promptly sent another even before I had packed up the faulty one.  Free postage on returns or free pickup by courier from my workplace.  Very easy.  Excellent service.
amazon	Miss Carol Riley	2011-12-10T22:58:26Z	5	I have been shopping with Amazon now for approx 2 years.  I have bought lots and lots of lovely things from this wonderful Company.  Never once been dissappointed!! . .Always been TRUE to thier word . .Delivery excellent. Great communication at all times.  I look forward to shopping LOTS again in  2012.  Thank you for all your support, and excellent professionalism!!.  A Very Happy Christmas to EVERYONE.

amazon	Mr B Foster	2011-12-08T08:01:41Z	3	Despite what they say, we have found returning stuff can be a real headache sometimes.  The process is a nonsense, and too long-winded.
amazon	Afrizha Ridwan Ahmad	2011-12-08T07:01:27Z	5	This site is very excellent and learning to make money for weeks.

amazon	Steve Cunio	2011-12-07T13:35:05Z	5	With very few exceptions Amazon has consistently the lowest prices and best standards of service on any shopping search.  Only thing to note is that other suppliers may not be quite as quick as an Amazon direct supply so this rating applies to items sold direct by Amazon only.
amazon	Mrs Eileen Hicks	2011-12-07T10:32:13Z	5	Amazon is always my first port of call as I know that I can always find just what I want.The site is very easy to use - even for a golden oldie like myself.They are the most reliable site i have used, keeping me informed every step of the way.

amazon	Customer	2011-12-02T00:35:54Z	5	Pretty much every order with this website has been on time and in perfect condition. The few that had problems were INSTANTLY sorted out by amazon and a replacement was sent out immediately (no questions asked). The website is brilliantly designed and the prices are almost always the best. I always order from amazon even if i find the product cheaper (rare) somewhere else.
amazon	Mrs B Winkworth	2011-12-01T21:05:57Z	5	not only do Amazon have milions of products but their fast reliable service is unequaled
amazon	Mr MJ Whitbread	2011-12-01T16:16:57Z	2	A right nonsense - Amazon need to seriously sort out their sales process - cumbersome and via $- eek!  Put me off for good.Then when added up the full price it cost more than getting in Tescos!Amazon, no wonder you're struggling...

amazon	George	2011-11-30T20:56:13Z	5	I am really amazed of the choice on amazon. A decade ago they started as I remember as one of the first bookshops online. They really trusted their guts! I love buying books for pennys. And never had anyproblems. Well done x
amazon	Nathaniel	2011-11-30T18:51:05Z	5	I love spending my paycheck on Amazon. There's always something that I need or want be it book, DVD or general trinket. The prices are almost second to none and I can hardly contain the confidence I have in Amazon as an online retailer.If Amazon have it and they have it at a good price, shop no further!

amazon	Neil Campbell	2011-11-30T10:17:17Z	5	Simple to use, always great prices, top quality service, why look elsewhere?
amazon	Andrew Rideout	2011-11-30T08:54:11Z	4	The measure of a good shop is, for me, customer service and Amazon have always dealt with any (infrequent) problems very well - things can be less easy with their affiliated stores sometimes, but buying direct from Amazon is easy and generally good value.
amazon	Viv Carbines	2011-11-29T23:56:47Z	5	First call whatever I need. Competetive prices, usually free postage & always arrives quickly. Can usually buy second-hand if you want, and money-back guarantees. What more could you want? They're the best!

amazon	peter francis	2011-11-27T22:41:26Z	5	Every product I have ordered from Amazon has been delivered quickly, and perfectly packed. Descriptions given by them are accurate and reviews by buyers extremely helpful. They are not frightened of publishing contrary opinions even if it means non sale of a particular article. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
amazon	Pamela Douglas	2011-11-26T23:50:43Z	5	My items always arrive promptly and the prices are competitive. Free delivery for only spending £15.  I do wish though that they wouldn't send items in several different parcels, sometimes even arriving the same day or one day apart when you have requested them being sent in one parcel.  A waste of packing materials..
amazon	Andrew Maltman	2011-11-26T20:03:56Z	5	While most orders are flawless the difference between good and excellent is how an organisation deals with a problem. First class
amazon	Zealous Web	2011-11-26T11:08:04Z	4	They have a great product range and on-time delivery, never heard of any mishaps. Most of the people who shop online, automatically goes to the Amazon site. That says it all. Great work and service.

amazon	Cyndizworld	2011-11-21T14:22:07Z	5	I shopped with Amazon several times with excellent results and the prices are low!  No shipping fees in most cases when you order a few items, sometimes even one item is free! I have never had a return problem so I could not tell you what the experience could be there but the fact I have not had to return anything says alot right there!
amazon	Mr Greer	2011-11-21T10:02:26Z	5	On time, well packaged and never really had any problems, thansk Amazon
amazon	Jules v.	2011-11-21T03:32:43Z	4	I can usualy find what I want at a price I am happy with.
amazon	Beth	2011-11-20T18:08:59Z	4	As a buyer: Items are generally as described. Delivery time is good but P&P for smaller items tends to be higher than the actual postage cost. Some sellers send items as individual packages whereas, if they combined items, this would save on postage and packaging. As a seller: Amazon's P&P policy seems imbalanced. Small items are overly expensive and larger items, that justify a higher P&P rate, are capped. For one item I sold, because of the P&P capping compared to the actual postage cost, in effect, I gave the book away.
amazon	Lacey	2011-11-20T17:40:47Z	5	Amazon constantly surprises me with what they stock, often selling items I would never have thought! You call trawl the web but more often than not Amazon's prices will not be beaten, especially considering their free, and speedy delivery. Simple to use and great value.
amazon	Richard	2011-11-20T14:54:33Z	1	As usual best price is never best expierience. I wish I'd never bought from amazon.
amazon	Phil	2011-11-19T00:13:42Z	5	I trust this company to deliver - everytime!

amazon	Brandon S Roberts	2011-11-18T03:13:54Z	5	Amazon has been my one stop spot for the lowest price, contrary to other online retailers I don't need to search all over the internet for coupons saving time and a headache!
amazon	Liam	2011-11-17T14:26:44Z	5	Never have had a problem with amazon, cheap and realible and they always go out there way if there is a problem.
amazon	Seow	2011-11-17T02:04:06Z	5	It is reliable, fast and efficient. Refund is never an issue if you don;t like the goods delivered. It has a whole variety of goods for all customers. It is the best online shopping gateway.
amazon	Jill J	2011-11-16T18:46:23Z	5	Love the free super saver delivery
amazon	K Kalatharan	2011-11-16T17:56:39Z	4	You can buy a lot of stuffs without worrying.
amazon	Barbara Rose	2011-11-16T13:07:23Z	5	I use Amazon as my first choice when buying anything as their service is brilliant.  I have had occasion to return items and there is no quibble and their response is fast and polite.Prices are usually very good and thoroughly recommend.
amazon	MARGARET and thanks for your order	2011-11-16T10:01:25Z	5	Amazon are, in my opinion one of the best companies out htere. If you are ever stuck for something, go to Amazon and 99.9 times you will find what you're looking for. Delivery is first rate as well and there is never any problems if you have to return anything. Tho I have to say this seldom happens to me.
amazon	c	2011-11-15T19:16:44Z	5	the best online store
amazon	MISCHU113	2011-11-15T10:01:27Z	5	I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE WORLD USED TO RUN WITHOUT AMAZON.  YOU CAN GET ANYTHING FROM THERE AND THE PRICES ARE ALWAYS GREAT.
amazon	Fiona	2011-11-15T05:35:54Z	3	I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.C'mon Amazon - we Aussies love you!
amazon	Kim	2011-11-14T12:26:04Z	5	Addictive!
amazon	Josh	2011-11-14T09:21:51Z	5	Having used Amazon for years they still delight and surprise.They're always so much cheaper than their competitors, for example 4th generation iPod Touch 8Gb is currently £15 cheaper than Argos and the same price as duty-free at Gatwick Airport.I always use the free super-saver delivery service which is quoted at 3-5 days. It's completely free - prices aren't inflated - yet the item will often arrive within three days. This free service is better than most paid-for delivery services.Always go to Amazon first.
amazon	Raymond Sterpaio	2011-11-14T09:10:20Z	5	Always a good efficient organization to deal with.
amazon	Customer	2011-11-13T22:48:35Z	5	User friendly; hassle free.

amazon	Blue	2011-11-11T01:47:07Z	1	I've used Amazon for a long time they used to be trustworthy an good to use. As time goes on they just get worse an worse... I had gift card problems an the real people I talked to it was like just TERRIBLE... Finally someone finished me up but they were PISSED an they made sure I knew it.... AND THEY!! Were a supervisor.... I went to order something recently cause I had a 25 dollar gift card an I'm all ready happy to use my gift card... Did not even cover the cost of shipment... I was ticked... So I went somewhere else an found almost everything cheaper... ONE ITEM I'd been waiting for was down in price so I clicked it an I waited lets say 3 hours? When I went to finish my order they double the price of the item an did not notify me or like a pop up NOTHING!! I officially hate Amazon... I used to think they were cool but it's just the same as Ebay (jab jab...) No deals here they should be ashamed >_<!@_o!
amazon	Ste	2011-11-10T22:36:03Z	4	Have had some great service from Amazon, but.... you have to check the prices, they are not always the cheapest, most of the time yes, just check, otherwise good.
amazon	Chris B	2011-11-10T15:37:23Z	2	Last two games that we pre-ordered failed to arrive on the day of release, failed to arrive the day after and the day after that.  indeed, pre-orders never seem to arrive.  The second star is purely becasue they refunded me promptly.  But surely the whole point of pre-ordering is to make sure you get the goods on release date!
amazon	Robert Quinn	2011-11-10T02:56:51Z	5	Best prices ever.
amazon	Sue Morgan	2011-11-09T20:10:42Z	5	excellent service

amazon	Nick D	2011-11-07T08:34:12Z	1	A great shame that they send out obviously damaged goods that you then have to mess around with to get returned.
amazon	Don Hamilton	2011-11-06T14:40:48Z	5	I messes up my order..They fixed it..Fast E-Mail response and great communication. They are a little slow in mailing but no problem getting your stuff..Seems to be a Great company. I will order again and don't expect any problems at all. Fantastic engraving on knifes I have ordered. They look great..I can;t brag enough on there commutation plus they have a phone that actually works, and someone actually picks up.

amazon	BERNIE MCTEAGUE	2011-11-05T19:16:10Z	3	"I found that some of the companies didn't export to ROI but they did not tell me this until I had all my credit card details given. I think that this should have been pointed out when I first put the items in the ""basket""Otherwise very happy with the service"

amazon	Theresa T. Sims	2011-11-03T07:49:58Z	5	I really don't have words to explain about Amazon. They are simply amazing when it comes to online retailing. They excel in all areas such as merchandising, customer service ,understand the customer needs and top notch service.
amazon	Penelope	2011-11-02T18:39:11Z	5	I can only recommend shoppping on amazon (and it doesn't matter which country you use they are all brilliant). I have been a customer on and off for quite a few years and am thoroughly impressed by the versatility that is now offered. Quick, reliable and good information about your products, especially the customer feedback. Well done amazon and I will continue to shop with you.

amazon	Ben	2011-11-01T13:24:47Z	5	Hello,I buy books on a regular basis from Amazon and am impressed with their service.  If I do have a complaint,  it is that the items seem to arrive before the informed date from Amazon.  Amazon also keep you well advised of any problems/delays with you order.
amazon	Pattie Hartshorne	2011-11-01T03:07:13Z	3	prices very good shame some items come not very well packed and have to go back replacement and refund policy very good shame i have to use it often

amazon	Patricia	2011-10-28T11:03:40Z	5	I have shopped with Amazon for a few years now and have never had a problem, when I have had problems with third party deliveries they have always come up trumps helping to sort them out.To be honest here, I much prefer to shop at Amazon than anywhereelse, I can see a full description of the product I am interested in, read customer reviews and most of the time Amazon are the cheapest.I hate to say it but I am probably helping the demise of the High Street but where can you get the service you get from them anywhere else.
amazon	William Pardi	2011-10-28T01:50:46Z	5	I love Amazon.com. I can usually find anything that I am looking for here, and usually at a pretty great price. I am a prime member so many of the items that I purchase offer free standard shipping. Everyone in my office knows that if I got something new it probably came from Amazon. Did I mention that I love Amazon.com?
amazon	Maz Lopez	2011-10-27T16:57:09Z	5	Always prompt to respond and go above and beyond other companies.
amazon	Murorga	2011-10-27T09:32:27Z	4	I buy regularly from Amazon and have never had any problems with them whatsoever.  Everything has been of great quality and the delivery has always been fast.Lots of my friends have found Kindles to break easily.  Amazon has always replaced these quickly and with no fuss whatsoever.  However, do be aware that your clippings and notes are lost in the process.Generally speaking, a great company.
amazon	Lin Col	2011-10-26T05:48:12Z	5	great price great offer
amazon	Curtiss Patrick	2011-10-25T20:51:15Z	5	My wife and I have ordered dozens of items through Amazon in the last year or so and every time it has arrived quickly and been exactly what we were looking for at a price we couldn't find anywhere else.

It is always easy to find a good selection of items, usually at fair prices. Delivery is very quick 2-4 days usually.  Easy to use account too. I have highly recommended Amazon to my friends and family.
amazon	Riaz	2011-10-24T09:01:00Z	1	when you become a seller on amazon and you start selling a great product. Amazon then contacts the company and starts to stock the item themselves which will drive your sales to 0. We were the only ones selling particular products, our amazon payments we over £8000 every 14 days, now we don't even hit £1000 as amazon started stocking ALL of them and if we try to compete with them in price, their software reduces their own price. ALL sellers must get together and either stop selling on amazon and make them stop doing this.
amazon	Ms Monique	2011-10-23T22:12:19Z	5	Excellent !

amazon	Tom Charles	2011-10-18T18:10:29Z	5	Was apprehensive about joining Prime - no worries - excellent communication and delivery as promised - will never shop anywhere else until I have accessed Amazon - incredible
amazon	martin	2011-10-18T15:51:09Z	5	a good way of getting good deals without going out on the high streeet in the winter. Also amazon has everything you want aswell so good for xmas, b'days.
amazon	Darren Burns	2011-10-18T15:46:25Z	4	In general i think their deliveries are a little slow and although they are cheap , they're not the cheapest. But for reliablity and overall quality of service you can beat them.
amazon	Tayo	2011-10-17T17:39:03Z	4	great selection but not always the best price. You can often get better deals on ebay even as 'but now' items. However the customer service is generally great ( bit slow but great) and there is that feeling of security like as if you go into a retail store.have used and will use again and again
amazon	Paul Edward Montador	2011-10-17T16:20:47Z	5	Amazon is simple to use, and easier to pay.Fantastic Website with just about anything you would want to purchase, and can send worldwide by adding in different shipping addresses to your account.Highly recommended
amazon	Catherine Kaiser	2011-10-15T22:44:11Z	5	I have had to return 2 items over the last couple of months and it is an easy process.  Thanks for taking the headache out of returns
amazon	Desnaldo	2011-10-14T19:39:08Z	5	Love shopping on this site.  Always a value.
amazon	Charlotte in London	2011-10-13T11:41:14Z	5	Fast delivery, reasonable postage charges and a great, no-fuss returns policy make Amazon a firm favourite. A very clear, easy-to-navigate site with plenty of consumer reviews, good technical information about products and the alternative option of buying used versions of the products in many cases makes this a first-class shopping site.
amazon	Jenny	2011-10-12T14:45:07Z	5	Amazon have long been my preffered site for ordering books, as they give a fair price for new books with the option of nearly new and used books at great prices. Now I have started using the site for toys, brands and more; the service is great, the delivery times very quick and I have even returned items just because I didn't want them at no quibble at all. Versatile site for searching for presents for children and adults alike, a must have site at your command.
amazon	Marilyn	2011-10-12T13:41:58Z	5	Brilliant all-round site - wide variety of products available and excellent prices.Amazon Kindle is a fantastic product - buying books has never been so easy!
amazon	Ross	2011-10-12T10:44:53Z	3	I have purchased a couple of times from Amazon and have always recieved the gear eventually.One book that was in stock took 4 weeks.One set of CDs that were also in stock and I paid priority postage for were still bouncing back and forward with a delivery companythat didn't understand their own network. Eventually had to change delivery address to get the goods 4 weeks after Christmas.Careful which delivery option you choose!
amazon	James Taylor	2011-10-12T01:23:40Z	1	I don't like how they have navigation. It seems so cluttered. So small. Confusing. and just blah. I can't say I'll be back to this site...
amazon	Joebob Richards	2011-10-12T01:17:15Z	5	Excellent site with easy navigation, verty thorough product information pages, and so much more that I can't explain every bit of it. overall, awesome.
amazon	Susannah P.	2011-10-11T19:03:57Z	5	i use amazon a lot.  I live in europe half the year and uk the rest of the time - amazon delivers everytime, i really appreciate the service.
amazon	Michael	2011-10-11T17:57:40Z	5	I bought some vinyl records from amazon recently, but when they arrived I found they had warped from heat and were damaged beyond repair. I contacted customer service and they immediately offered to send me replacements, without even requesting that I send back the defective items first. This is top class customer service!
amazon	Wojtek Polka	2011-10-10T16:05:37Z	5	If you haven't found this yet, it's an amazing service, and while it costs around £50 a year, if you do a lot of shopping online you'll soon be quids in, as Amazon prime gives you delivery by 1pm next day free as part of the package.  You can have your work address and your home address set up as delivery points.  It makes online shopping so easy, I can't recommend it highly enough
amazon	Ian	2011-10-10T09:21:34Z	5	i'm a massive fan of Amazon.  I do all of my book, games and music shopping here.  It certainly makes Christmas shopping a whole lot easier every year.  Excellent service, prompt delivery and good after sales customer care.
amazon	gigi	2011-10-07T09:09:59Z	5	i have been ordering books form amazon and in amazon , you can always search for many type of interesting book with very good price
amazon	Per Edblad	2011-10-06T09:55:06Z	5	I find everything I need here and with good information I selldom need to get information from other places than just here. Custom in my country take a special fee for some items and maybe that is good cause else I would buy many, many things.
amazon	Roberto Vianello	2011-10-05T07:01:47Z	5	Absolutely correct.Thank you
amazon	Jack Mao	2011-10-04T22:09:05Z	5	These guys do business and they do it right. Items that you buy from them are guaranteed to arrive at the shipping speed that you tag onto your order and the customer service is great. Very on top of things and they truly want to make sure that you have a great buying experience. On top of that, they offer pretty good discounts on a lot of the items people normally buy, which is definitely a plus. Will definitely buy from in the future. I highly recommend buying from them.
amazon	Ian Newton	2011-10-04T15:15:18Z	4	Sell nearly everything at excellent prices, all prices shown up front.keep up the good work.
amazon	Heather	2011-10-04T13:44:17Z	5	Love this website, they have everything you want for a great price and you don't need to wait for bidding like on eBay, on click and it's yours.The paying is really secure, I have used this loads and I keep coming back because of the delivery speed.I trust them 100% whether I'm buying directly from amazon or from their sellers (they have a really helpful rating system).Also, if you spend more than £15 when buying from amazon they give you free delivery, that's a lot better than everywhere else !
amazon	John Ioannou	2011-10-04T13:13:32Z	5	5 star for customer service, altough I would have been happier if the money had not been deducted from my credit card until the order was ready for dispatch.
amazon	Kaushik Kerai	2011-10-04T12:01:07Z	5	was very impressed with the choice available & how easy it was to order. The watches matched the description & delivery was prompt. My two boys absolutely loved the watches.
amazon	Owen Griffiths	2011-10-03T20:48:03Z	5	Nobody.  Amazon have never failed to meet the highest standard of online retail.I am a regular user of Amazon for buying bits and pieces as I need them; everything from shoes and accessories to games and electronics.  Their prices aren't ALWAYS the cheapest, but there are times I have been willing to pay that bit extra knowing it's coming from Amazon.  And when I do have a problem with an order, it has been resolved to my satisfaction every time.No two ways about it - Amazon.co.uk is the way forward for online shopping.
amazon	Paul	2011-10-03T20:41:01Z	5	"My wife and I are dedicated Kindle fans and Amazon customers. They released the new line of Kindle's this week which made us both happy (it's the best e-reader out there and improving it even more is terrific) and a little frustrated. You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old.I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India.The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board.While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty."

amazon	S Hislop	2011-09-22T21:10:03Z	4	Saves me a fortune when I look at how many times I've bought from them and not paid delivery. Only downside is you spend too much with them when you have a prime account
amazon	John Donaby	2011-09-22T11:46:48Z	5	Amazon has always got what you need!
amazon	Katharina Berg	2011-09-21T10:45:08Z	4	Easy to navigate, perfect user experience design, perfect behavioral targeting etc
amazon	James, Birmingham	2011-09-20T20:19:56Z	5	Excellent fast delivery. Fast helpful customer service and competitive prices. What more can you ask for.
amazon	Cynthia	2011-09-20T17:35:49Z	5	"I've shopped at amazon.com for more than a decade now, and seen this web site rise up from a simple place to purchase books to one of the most reliable places to order just about anything. Amazon's customer service is so fabulous that if I can find the same thing available through amazon or somewhere else, I've often made the choice to purchase on amazon, thanks to its exceptionally reasonable return policies, and the fact that just about anything amazon ships is perfectly packaged and speedily shipped. Amazon now sells some items which are shipped through ""third parties,"" and the same level of consistency in quality packaging, speedy shipping and items being as advertised may not always apply to such third parties. I especially love amazon's product reviews, and it's links to show what other customers often eventually purchase after viewing a particular item, and I love the way amazon makes it easy to quickly find and read both glowing and critical reviews, to ferret out the real scoop on a particular item. Reviews are voted upon, so more detailed and fair-minded reviews are easy to find, and shoppers can fast become well-educated on just about anything and everything. Amazon is also great for internet window shopping!"
amazon	Malcolm	2011-09-20T10:40:49Z	5	Amazon is now our first stop for online shopping. Great prices and usually delivered in 48 hours. What more can you ask for!
amazon	kayleigh	2011-09-19T20:42:49Z	1	i use this company on a regular basis and will keep doing so not been let down yet
amazon	Ken Richards	2011-09-19T17:56:38Z	4	Overall I rate Amazon as A-.  Deliveries are sometimes optimistic in that the date given prior to ordering is sometimes altered after placing an order. When an order does go wrong (infrequently) Amazon usually pull out all the stops to remedy the situation.Getting final invoices from some of their partner companies can also be difficult.
amazon	Dave Oliver Maine	2011-09-19T17:51:55Z	5	order Saturday arrived Tuesday
amazon	GEOFF THATCHER	2011-09-19T09:12:13Z	5	Thoughout the years of using Amazon I have had 1 small problem which was totally resolved in days.I cannot praise the service I have had highly enough !.

amazon	Phil Crabill	2011-09-17T17:07:09Z	5	If you want it and it is legal, they have it at a good price and prompt shipping.
amazon	Cable Monkey	2011-09-17T08:07:04Z	2	another great company, but I worry about  their growing dominance across so many retail sectors.  Variety as they say is the spice of life
amazon	Nate	2011-09-15T18:01:49Z	4	Up until recently I have been a Amazon Prime fanboy, but I have been burnt twice by it. So it started simple enough good idea, free two day shipping, however movies kind of sucks, they have less than Netflix, but all in all love it for buying my computer parts that I cannot get for less than I get from a company discount(monitors, printers, etc). My fiancé decided to sign up for the Mom account, this is a quick setup, but what wasn't clear is that this will cancel my prime account. So my prime account was canceled, oh well just get it fixed, so the credited me the difference in shipping cost to my prime account cost. So I called to get this error fixed, and the customer service rep, credited my account the shipping account so I would pay for Prime - credit, which would be fine.This is where the second problem was, so they charged my account the full Prime account cost, so one person set it up wrong? So they decided to credit my account and cancel it, not the best move to get repeat customers. So with that said Amazon 5 stars Prime 3 stars, maybe Prime should model themselves off of Amazon being such a great service!Maybe if they fix this I would recommend them, but not now.
amazon	Vicky  Williams	2011-09-15T08:57:40Z	5	Speed of service
amazon	Ann	2011-09-15T06:45:18Z	5	I have nothing bad to say about Amazon.com.  I have a prime membership which means that for about $80/year, I and 4-5 other family members have free 2-day shipping for an entire year.  You can see that if you divide that fee between everyone, that it becomes quite reasonable.  I have a Kindle, and I absolutely love it - I no longer have to find more bookshelving for my expanding library.  Amazon is a real winner!!!
amazon	Customer wendy	2011-09-14T20:21:21Z	5	Easy to use for a  non competent computer user like myself.
amazon	KEITH PATTERSON	2011-09-14T11:37:21Z	3	Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.
amazon	Lizz	2011-09-13T16:37:08Z	4	LOVE amazon! Its usually my first port of call for internet shopping; but if its not, then i do use it for internet price comparisons. everything i can think of is on amazon! However, i do find it a bit frustrating that amazon have other 'market place sellers' so if you have an order with different sellers you have to pay different postage costs.... been caught out a couple of times. :-SOn the whole, competitively priced and very useful!
amazon	Nicholas Capozzi	2011-09-12T22:11:43Z	5	Perhaps the best company in the world
amazon	Customer RTB	2011-09-12T11:13:17Z	5	Excellent service and so easy to use
amazon	bryan	2011-09-11T20:00:59Z	5	I buy a lot from amazon.  There prices are great.  They now have amazonbasics which provide great prices on some simple products.  If you buy more then a few things a year.  Get amazon prime and split it with a friend.  2 day free shipping changes the prices of so many things that it becomes a simple decision to save gas and just buy online
amazon	Customer  Derek Miles	2011-09-11T08:46:49Z	5	The perfect company for just about all things.

amazon	Allie Davidge	2011-08-24T19:33:07Z	5	Can always find what I want at good prices with good delivery. I like the review process as well.
amazon	Yvonne Hin	2011-08-24T17:48:34Z	5	Amazon has so many products on offer online it is quite unbelievable. I often do research into products on google and then check to see if Amazon has it cheaper which to be honest very often is the case. Also the service is brilliant and I have never had to wait for a product long (unless clearly stated). The fact that you can also get nectar points is brilliant for me as well as I am a enthousiastic collecter. Anyway, brilliant company. Although......I am quite aware that other, smaller companies are probably going under because amazon can and does tend offer it cheaper than they can.
amazon	Anne Swann	2011-08-24T13:44:54Z	5	We have used Amazon many times for purchasing numerous items ranging from tweezers to Hi Fi equipment. Any problems are dealt with swiftly & efficiently causing little or no inconvenience. They provide an excellent one stop on line store.
amazon	George Morten	2011-08-22T21:47:02Z	5	I love Amazon, it's has pretty much anything you could ever want at great prices. I always opt for the fulfiled by Amazon option and usually receive my items in 1-2 days in perfect condition!
amazon	wayne	2011-08-20T19:29:57Z	1	Bought 5 items from amazon over 2 days, the delivery companies they use govern when or if we receive the item, Home delivery network are a useless buch of scruffy oiks that lie on the delivery sheet, turn up if an when they feel like it, and faced with a 300mtr dive up the lane to my house would rather mark the item undeliverable and send it back. Amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re-order it....HELLO MUPPETS>>>>THATS WHY I ORDERED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.... Wont order from Amazon again as If i order on line i EXPECT it to be deliveredI did order with another on line shop and had it delivered NEXT DAYShould have a NEGATIVE STAR SYSTEM one star is far too generous for these AMAZONIAN MUPPETS

amazon	Customer	2011-08-17T17:46:58Z	1	Amazon is good if you are a buyerVery ppor for sellers. High % costs, and more importantly, your entire account may be suspended due to 1 complaint, despite you have years of postivies feedback. Would much rather sell and use EBAY!
amazon	ScottScot	2011-08-16T23:27:05Z	5	Use Amazon all the time for buying stuff. Have never had any problems and have ordered more than 30 items. Always arrives quickly and well packaged. App for Iphone is so easy to use and prices are more often than not the cheapest or there abouts. Would recommend to everyone!
amazon	Loutjie Lolo	2011-08-16T15:27:45Z	3	Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.
amazon	Cris	2011-08-16T14:45:10Z	5	"Amazon is very easy to buy and sell.  It is very easy to find an item and list it. The only problem I see is Amazon wants to take the opportunity to sell toys away from the everyday user around this time of year.  Of course if you are a monthly subscriber and use ""fulfillment by Amazon"" feature you can still sell toys.  What a shame they don't think more about the ""little guys"".  Sad, but true."
amazon	Peter T	2011-08-15T20:40:43Z	5	The most amazing shopping experiance ever
amazon	W D Glover	2011-08-15T16:58:55Z	5	I have purchased many items and Amazon have never failed to come up trumps. I like their security as someone tried to purchase an item with my card number but Amazon quickly killed the purchase 'cos the crook had put in his address for delivery. Amazon only have mine in their records so refused the purchase.

amazon	Greg	2011-08-15T11:47:20Z	5	Honestly, where else do you need to go for a stress-free, in your own home, take as long as you like shopping experience? It's ideal for busy times such as Christmas, and the best thing is you can do it in your pyjamas!

amazon	Steve Brown	2011-08-04T04:06:44Z	3	I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.
amazon	Rob	2011-08-03T20:48:10Z	5	Amazon is the only place I will go to on line to search for and buy products. They have every item you could think of for sale. I have bought a good few items from them and have never ever had a problem.The best bar none!!!

amazon	J Jenson	2011-07-13T02:38:56Z	2	Searches for electronics return a net full of useless results.  So annoying!  Then throw 20 promotions at me at the same time.
amazon	Nick Hebert	2011-07-12T21:33:31Z	5	great company and good returns and easy to deal with
amazon	Jamie	2011-07-11T22:26:13Z	5	All my products from amazon arrived really quick and ive had no issues.
amazon	Ms Wilson	2011-07-10T20:39:26Z	5	I just love Amazon, I am an avid reader and you can't beat the prices and range on Amazon for new books. Never had any issues with my purchases.
amazon	Ryan Hogan	2011-07-05T09:10:16Z	5	My only problem with Amazon is AmazonPrime doesn't work on all orders.  I wish it did.  Other than that I've had nary an issue with them.
amazon	Kaytie.	2011-07-02T18:02:24Z	5	Bargains all round on amazon, i buy so much stuff off this site from shoes to books. Just would so recommend amazon :) I would say watch out for delivery charges on some items though.
amazon	Cody H.	2011-07-01T11:30:32Z	4	Everytime I look for something in particular, I always check in amazon.com, even if it's something I found on a retail shop, because the most of the times it's cheaper. You can find really big deals in there. Anyway I like to compare different prices and references, but this one might be my favourite, I guess.
amazon	Greg	2011-06-30T21:15:31Z	4	I am an amazon addict, I do almost all my online shopping on amazon these days.
amazon	Mr Gosney	2011-06-24T09:10:00Z	5	Visiting Amazon website is a pleasure--almost too tempting. It's easy to find what you are looking for & many items are delivered without charge. I like being able to find pre-owned books at bargain prices & being offered suggestions for what might interest me. Friends & relatives might tire of my enthusiasm if they were not as keen on Amazon as I am.
amazon	Customer93:)	2011-06-21T14:30:51Z	5	i love amazon! its quick and easy! :D
amazon	BazilxXx	2011-06-16T00:45:30Z	5	Whenever I'm making a purchase, I always check prices on Amazon first. Now I have the Apple App with BarCode scanner on my iPhone4 I will have to watch I don't get kicked out of stores scanning products. :)
amazon	Deborah Crew-Johnson	2011-06-07T19:43:13Z	4	Amazon has a great variety and selection of just about anything you need.  They are very reliable and the orders arrive pretty quickly.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 because I'm not happy with the S&H charges. I think these charges have increased dramatically.  I understand an adjustment in rates due to the oil and gas prices and here's an example of what I mean:   I ordered an item for $4.79 and had to pay $7.97 for S&H charges.  In the same order I was charged $29.94 for a $59.94 order although the items were being shipped from different locations.  I'm trying to decide whether I want to keep my order because of this.  Outside of this, I love Amazon!!!
amazon	Barbara Fowles	2011-06-05T13:33:29Z	5	i have shopped with this site from usa, i worked doing their tasks, excellent, the only problem is you are limited to what you can buy, but very good and always received goods on time.
amazon	Jake	2011-05-15T04:27:42Z	5	I have been spoiled with Amazon prime service. Before I occasionally bought products on Amazon with the free super saver shipping. But after my one month trial I was hooked. I piratically buy anything I can on amazon. Everything for Electronics to Cereal they got!
amazon	reddiemail	2011-04-26T19:44:23Z	5	my case cover was causing my kindle to reboot everytime I opened it. I called Amazon. Immediately, they refunded the case cover and deposited $60 to get a different case cover. I am happy the way they handle this matter so efficiently. They recognize the issue and provide the solution at once. Great service!
amazon	jerry	2011-04-16T03:29:58Z	4	"Overall, not a bad company to buy from.  They have almost everything in the known universe, and if you are patient and low maintenance, service is not bad.  I don't think service can ever be better than not bad due to the fact that it is a mall store.  I've sent maybe a dozen inquiries to various vendors and have had one response.  The one response I did receive was that the vendor ""would research and get back to me"" and of course they never did.  And that was regarding an order that never showed up!  Luckily, Amazon does have their A-Z Guarantee.  They did step in and refund my money.  The layout is awful.  Product descriptions are vague and not logically placed.  Most seem like they are updated by mass data feed with little regard for editing or accuracy.  ""Fuzzy"" would be a nice way of describing most of their product images.I have to say they among the best at taking an order.  If I know exactly what I want, I can order from my computer or my phone in seconds.  For browsing and research, forget it.  I'll bet you a nickel it's like that by design to prevent lookey-loo's from tying up bandwith.  Smart, I guess.Aside from Walmart and the IRS, I don't know of any other organization with a worse customer experience but can still continue to get my money.  Overall though, not bad at serving its purpose.  I do keep coming back."
amazon	Mike Medoro	2011-04-11T18:46:13Z	4	I am always happy with how quickly I get my items from Amazon.com.  I have even ordered from some of the smaller retailers within Amazon's network, and I always get my items quickly.
amazon	Johnny	2011-04-08T07:22:58Z	2	I used to sell on Amazon and I have to say - its seller beware - they have 0 loyalty to sellers.  As a buyer their service is world class however.  They feed their products based on their sellers and then compete with the sellers to attain the business themselves.  Its a good / safe place to shop - not recommended as much for selling as the platform for selling is flawed.
amazon	J	2011-03-11T16:41:07Z	5	Ill start with I buy from Amazon.com ALL the time. Anything from MP3 downloads, Dvd's and blue rays to TV's . I bought The stargate SG-1 collection from them and the timing of delivery was fast and the product pricing was incredible. I bought it for about half of what I would have had to purchase it for in the local stores. I wont even talk about how many MP3 downloads I have purchased! I would recommend Amazon to anyone. They are one of the best shopping online experiences I have ever had!
amazon	William	2011-02-24T21:26:06Z	5	I have been an Amazon.com customer for quite a long time.If there are any issues I can count on Amazon.com customer support to remedy the issue.Sometimes they will go beyond their terms just to solve an issue.Amazon prime is great if you are a frequent Amazon.com shopper and in addition to the free 2 day shipping from prime, they recently started free Instant Video.They have also been actively monitoring their competitors' prices to price their products competitively.Large product offerings, good prices, and superior customer service = 5/5 stars.
amazon	Bhaskar Dutta	2011-01-10T04:36:18Z	3	I really love the product range at Amazon.comHowever, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD)If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me.Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of service from Amazon.
amazon	Juan Manuel Lizarazu	2011-01-06T06:01:17Z	5	I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the cheap prices from the sellers on Amazon.com US compared to Amazon.fr France.The sellers on Amazon.fr sell the digital cameras at almost double the prices that I found on Amazon.com
amazon	Joseph DeFauw	2010-11-26T23:31:39Z	5	Since 2006, we have placed almost a hundred orders with Amazon.com.  To the best of my memory, we have never had to contact customer service, and we have never had any bad experiences with Amazon or with anyone who was selling on Amazon.  They seem to be a very well run company.  I realize that not everyone will have such good luck, but their overall record is probably very good.     For $90 a year we get amazon prime, which means we get free two day shipping on most items that are ordered directly from Amazon.  Since we get the free shipping, it is very difficult for other websites (where we usually have to pay shipping) to compete with Amazon.  That is why we end up placing most of our orders with Amazon.  Amazon prime was a smart idea.     What makes shopping on Amazon such a great experience is that alot of people write reveiws of the products on Amazon.  That helps us alot when we make our buying decisions.     I do not recall any bad experiences with the vendors who sell on the Amazon marketplace.   However, some vendors are slower than others.  If you order from an unfamiliar vendor, be prepared to wait.     So far, we have been very satisfied.   Hope they keep up the good work!
amazon	Ester Engly Jacobsen	2010-11-04T13:38:52Z	5	amazon.com is easy  and cool at shop whit and great sellers too
amazon	C.M. Hwieze	2010-11-03T12:15:51Z	4	I have ordered countless times from amazon and have always been pleased with the quality and the manner of timely delivery for the items. The reason why I give amazon only 4 stars is because their prices fluctuate a lot. I ordered a handbag from amazon and within a week, the price dropped  10 dollars less than what I paid for. I know I have already gotten such a great deal but the price fluctuation made me think I was being cheated.They should have within their policy of price adjustment especially when the price drops within the week of being ordered.Other than that, Amazon is great and it is one of the stores I frequently shop from.They also have free returns on clothing and other select accessories which makes it such a great place to shop from.
amazon	saratje	2010-10-27T16:55:03Z	5	wow what a fast delivery, and I live oversees!the only thing i think they should do is, for us who have to pay importtaxes in europe, is extract the us taxes.
amazon	Tommy	2010-10-26T12:33:55Z	5	Very good information about offered products, informative user reviews!Sending back if not satisfied is good supported.
amazon	Michele	2010-10-26T07:11:46Z	5	Amazon.com has everything and usually has the best price. I belong to Amazon Prime, so all of my items are shipped 2-day and sometimes they come before that. When I have an issue (rare), I call customer service and they do the best they can to make me happy :-)
amazon	JJ	2010-10-15T00:08:55Z	5	So far I have yet to have a problem with them. I've ordered everything from books to software to kitchen products. When my credit card offers me reward points, I generally take them as Amazon store credit because I know I'll find a use for it.Sometimes I almost feel bad for brick & mortar stores because it's often cheaper to order through Amazon than to get books even on sale.Would definitely recommend to others.
amazon	Chris	2010-10-13T16:32:06Z	4	Bought some stuff as gift for my friends in the US. I used my Ireland credit card and the gifts were delivered on time and in perfect condition!The fx rates aren't the best in the market (actually, they are a bit bad). So thats something you might want to look out for! Sometimes, it might be worth paying in your own the specific currency than in your own currency, as yopu bank might offer you a better rate.But I would definitelky deal with them again
amazon	Tiny	2010-09-22T19:36:24Z	2	I order a notebook laptop. The delivery was very good i ordered it Thursday and it arrived Friday day but i paid for the service which was around £9. I was so disappointed when i open it because it was advertised as having a centrino processor but got the celeron. When i look at the website it has gone down in price from £390 to £377.I rang amazon, the man on the other line was very helpful he said he will investigate and will give me a replacement. When i mentioned about it has gone down in price so they should give me the price advertise now, he said that the price advertised now is from the third party seller. So they will refund me and it will take 2 weeks before they can return my money. More frustrating because i wanted the laptop immediately that is why i paid for the fast delivery. He arranged for it to be returned via DHL at first he said i should arrange the pick up myself but i insisted he should arrange it that very moment.I still have to wait when my money will be refunded.A very unsatisfied customer
amazon	Fiona McCarthy	2010-09-01T19:23:37Z	5	I get most of my school books from Amazon, as well as electronics and other knick knacks. I love the free super saver shipping deal they have and they usually ship pretty fast. Amazon usually has pretty good deals on their items compared to other websites.  I have never had a problem with them!
amazon	YogiBear	2010-08-20T00:36:05Z	5	I've ordered several things from Amazon from cheap camera lenses to books. The order always processes quickly and the item(s) always arrive earlier than they say (at least in my experience). The one time I had a problem was when I ordered a textbook from a new user (my/big mistake) and they refused to answer emails. I contacted Amazon and they issued me a refund after the estimated arrival time had passed. Just make sure you use trusted users!
amazon	Zeynep &#214;yk&#252;	2010-07-14T11:19:41Z	4	Sometimes items arrive even faster than expected, always in good condition. I can always find the book I want. Only one I had a problem with them, they didn't have the item I bought and for about a year they kept postponing the shipment, until finally they refunded my money. But that was a very hard to find book so they can be forgiven.
amazon	Wallace	2010-07-01T04:55:50Z	4	I've shopped with Amazon for years and always had great experiences when dealing directly with them.  Some years ago they started selling stuff for third-party retailers.  The few times I've tried the third-party listings never quite seemed up to the same standards as Amazon, so now I avoid them.  But so long as I deal directly with Amazon the experiences have always been great.
amazon	Joseph Higgins	2010-06-29T13:42:49Z	5	Greatest customer service ever.  Speedy delivery with prime.  I love you Amazon.com !
amazon	Shaun Overmeyer	2010-06-27T15:18:13Z	5	I have bought several items from this company. Every deal has been a pleasure. Items arrive on time, better than estimated. Good cutomer follow-up. This is how online shopping should be.Gr8
amazon	Eliana Doll	2010-04-17T21:53:20Z	5	I think amazon's trading system is way off better than eBay. I personally feel more secure buying on amazon.
amazon	Dan Caravan	2010-04-10T02:14:53Z	5	What an insanely great website!!
amazon	Jon Wellington	2010-04-04T22:57:17Z	4	I had a problem with an order, and it took awhile to figure out how to contact them, but once I did, I was able to get things resolved. TIP: go into your account and find your order and then you can use that order to contact Amazon by online email.
amazon	Sarah	2010-04-02T04:32:26Z	4	Great prices and service. Shipping time and cost not ideal to Australia though
amazon	barb	2010-03-24T18:11:02Z	4	only place i go for new items.
amazon	mafdrruhgfty	2010-01-29T08:16:22Z	5	While our rates include all shipping costs, you may still be responsible for certain customs, tariffs, or taxes levied against your shipment. Viaddress.com is not responsible for any delays in shipping associated with customs difficulties. For more information, we suggest contacting your local customs office.so it is very lowest price for any service holder
amazon	Sussie	2010-01-03T00:32:26Z	5	I've shopped at amazon a few times now, and it's been a good experience every time.The merchandise is new and cheap, and the international shipping is fast!
amazon	Indira Persad	2009-10-05T23:44:12Z	5	"awesome ""used"" sectionsI absolutely LOVE amazon! I have used their website for years, particularly for used books, movies and cds (both school-related and for fun). They often have great deals on their new items as well, making it more cost-effective to buy it brand new for a dollar or two more rather than a used copy. I have also used it to re-sell my old books. Whether as a buyer or seller, the customer service is great. I find using Amazon is MUCH more user-friendly than ebay or other comparable websites."
amazon	beverly rogers	2009-08-21T19:35:13Z	5	I have shopped Amazon for years and have never been disappointed.  Most times, I can buy what I want with just one click and I have the product the next day.
amazon	Mike Sharon	2009-08-17T23:12:57Z	5	I ordered a razor off Amazon.com and within two days it was at my house. Amazing! Amazon lets you pay $80 per year and receive free two-day shipping on everything. It's really a great deal.
amazon	JMac	2009-07-20T03:39:15Z	4	I have had plenty of opportunities to shop on amazon.com over the past several months.  It has become one of my favorite sites to visit. I have purchased items directly sold by amazon.com and from other sellers on the site with great success.  Amazon.com is a very reliable seller, with quick shipping and excelent service.  I love their free shipping on certain items.  I had a large portable hammock shipped to me for FREE.  Love it!  It was a gift for my dad and he loves it too.  It's great quality and very easy to use.  I've had some complaints when purchasing through other sellers on the site for slow shipping but overall have been very satisfied and have never not received an item or received my pruchase damaged.  Highly recommend amazon.com!
amazon	Simba	2009-05-25T00:01:30Z	5	I ordered a book and the item arrived in 48 hours. I am very happy about the service from Amazon UK.
amazon	Joseph Barra	2009-05-01T02:43:24Z	5	Lowest price on-line. Free shipping. Delivery within 24 hours. WOW!!!
amazon	sauron	2009-04-23T02:01:19Z	4	I've used Amazon several times, buying everything from books to cameras, but one thing that always annoyed me is that they don't offer pay pal as a payment option.
amazon	Vinny Napolitano	2009-04-12T23:05:11Z	5	I buy almost everything I need at Amazon.  Service is excellent and the few times I had to return something it was quick and easy.
amazon	Anders T	2009-03-22T13:14:12Z	5	I have had perfect order fulfillment, and fast delivery from Amazon, probably my favorite online retailer when I can use them. Their resellers have been very good too. Amazon.com ++++++++++++++
amazon	David E	2008-12-31T18:57:31Z	5	I have had perfect order fulfillment, and fast delivery from Amazon (helps that I live near Seattle!), probably my favorite online retailer when I can use them.  Their resellers have been very good too (surprisingly). Amazon must crack the whip ;)
amazon	Joseph Harding	2008-09-16T13:05:05Z	3	I always find myself going back to amazon becouse there prices are so good, however i have had several bad experiences while buying from resellers that are allowed to advertise on there site, with one delivery taking two weeks to arrive, the real sting in the tail was that the HD-dvd went bust a couple of weeks later
amazon	Mads Dørup	2008-04-28T11:09:05Z	5	"I have placed an abundance of orders with Amazon during the last couple of years, none of which gave me any trouble. I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* ""Supersaver"" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shopsI hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon.All in all though, one of the best shops online."
amazon	Kim Fuglsang Kramer	2007-08-27T17:25:01Z	4	those goods i've ordered by Amazon.com, have been delivered in good order, even as it is an international delivery, since i live in Denmark, I expected there would be some weeks before i would get my goods. the only thing i find a bit frustrating at times is, sometimes, the late announcement of goods that are out of stock. otherwise very good conditions.
